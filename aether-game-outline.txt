Simple things to Work On:
==========================
3. Name Aylmera's fabled Greatsword.
	- Hero = Aylmera: Slayer of the Damned and Martyr of Antiquity
		~ The Hero was known for slaying heathens, the undead, and for ultimately sacrificing themselves to protect a catacombs from being lost to necromancers.
		~ In a last ditch effort, she sealed himself inside to seal the enemy out. This worked, but they died and their body was excavated many months later.
	- Sword = ???
11. Design the full 12 tile sprites for the King.
	- Also design a 4 tile sprite for him.
17. Build out the actual menu options.
	- Design an inventory system that can hold gold, basic healing items, key items, and equippables (e.g. swords).
18. Design a landscape scene with panning and parallax
19. Draw a cutaway scene for a roaring fireplace.
	- Also design the tile sprite for this fireplace.
21. Add a balcony to the War Room.
	- Have a ceiling the player passes under to walk outside.
		~ Feature a cutaway scene to a POV vista showing the city beyond the castle.
		~ Also needs a vista to be shown in the background of the surrounding landscape.
22. Design the Battle scene. And test swapping in different enemies to the encounter.
23. Design trinkets for the tables.
	- Battle maps, figurines, pots full of scrolls, potted plants.
	- Also design a Grandfather clock.
24. Implement the journal menu option. It records core details for the player, so they know their objective.
	- Doesn't need to be robust, just marks down main plot points they've learned so they don't get lost.
	- Would love it to look like pages in a book which you can turn through. (Perhaps a static # of pages that get filled in as you complete core objectives.)
29. Store the Key Items separate from regular items.
	- This way a player knows the difference, and they'll always have room for Key Items.
34. Finish the book in the East Hallway detailing a history of the Realm.
	- Describe the bitter war fought with the Mad Wizard.
	- Only mention details up to the conflict, but not mentioning the Great Explosion or the Aether Ruins.
	- Instead focus on the betrayal of the King, the Prince's attempted assassination, and the practice of necromancy.
	- Also mention how the Wizards took to the Great Tower, while raiding the catacombs for undead soldiers.
35. Come up with a name for the King.
	- Reginald? Octavian?
36. Design a neutral soldier sprite.
	- And assign it to the NPC in the War Room.
37. Design a Chapel in the city or castle.
41. Design the Armory which will give you some starting gear for free if you stop by.
	- This is optional.
42. Figure out how to draw Text to the Screen for the start menu options.
43. Add a cutaway scene to examining the sacred blade on the wall behind the King.
	- Consider making it a different weapon. Maybe a polearm?
	- Also redesign the tile for it when you do update it.
44. Finish the King's dialogue for when you have the Jester in your party.
46. Make an initial copy of the game to Git for safekeeping.
47. Flesh out Alexandros' backstory somewhere
	- He's Alexandros the Gifted. One of the first wizards to agree to an armistice following the Great Explosion.
48. Add a health item that can be looted off the Dining Hall's table.
	- Like a shank of meat or something.
50. Design sideways facing chairs for the dining hall.
51. Add crates and old things (leaning portraits, etc) to the Hidden Alcove.
	- Make it seem like a room cluttered with old junk.
52. Design medieval torture devices to fill the Oubliette with
	- Stretching table
54. Add notes describing an ancient revival ritual to a table in the Oubliette.
	- Obviously, this is to give backstory on how Aylmera is revived.
56. Design tiles for the kitchen
	- Cheese, barrels, kegs (on their sides), wine racks, cupboards, ladle, knives.
57. Design a pile of bones tile for the Oubliette.
	- Look at the LoZ botw fan art. Also look at oracle of ages/seasons for reference.
58. Figure out how to draw tiles in front of the player.
	- Do this for the pillars in the throne room.
59. Remember to untoggle the hard-coded JesterRecruited variable in the Battle scene.
	- It's only on right now for testing.
60. I'd love for there to be a neutral actor in the middle part of the battle screen (showing who's turn it being selected).
	- It'd be even cooler if when the attacks are played out, they walked Left/Right to their target, then played a simple animation of attacking in front of them (at the NPC).
61. Design a few different Battle scene backgrounds (behind the enemy actor tiles).
	- These can be used for a few different environments.
		~ E.g. In a Cavern vs. On a beach vs. In a forest vs. In a castle.
		~ Nothing too complex, just a general vibe. The sprite limits will be close on these screens.
62. Design NPC sprites for the nobles in the Royal Court
63. Item ideas
	a. Wine: A Healing item
		~ Potentially temporarily lowers accuracy if used in combat.
65. Draw a jug of wine as a table-compatible sprite.
66. Update the oubliette to be slightly different upon returning after having the jester in your party.
	- Hide Alexandros
	- Have the wizards say different things.
67. Incorporate Lepers somewhere.
	- Perhaps a small village living in the remains of the abandoned settlement to the North-east?
68. Design additional rooms in the castle.
	- Off the doorways in the halls and throne room.
69. Draw beds for the Barracks and bedchambers
70. Design a basic drawbridge texture for the player to cross as they leave the Castle.
72. Design a flower pot that can be placed on the table tiles.
74. Design Pews for the Chapel.
	- Also design an altar and candles.
75. Draw a Monk sprite.
	- 4 tiles is fine for now.
	- Just needs to be a basic with the skirted egg hair and the classic brown robes with the rope belt.
76. Begin drawing the Prince's undead form
	- He can likely be a special enemy with a 32x32 sprite.
	- Make him hulking and massive. I'd love for him to hold his weapon off to the side.
		~ A la Saturos. Or even Pyramid head in some ways.
		~ It should seem a bit unwieldy and burdensome.
	- He should just be a hulking knight with big armor.
77. Draw an armor stand
78. Draw a weapon stand with spears and swords
79. Have the Bandit leader (one-eye) reveal that the Prince was not as noble as initially we were led to believe.
	- Though admirable and fearless, he forced many of his men to rush the Great Tower (recklessly) with threat of death to deserters.
	- As a result, many of the soldiers blame him and his foolishness for the Realm's inability to have a force leftover to fight the undead.
	- Therefore, many of them are joining forces with the bandits to attempt a rebellion.
80. Require talking to the King (with the Jester recruited) before leaving the Castle
81. Add a location with a full-scale cathedral.
	- The castle should only have a tiny chapel instead.
82. As the player and their party approaches the Aether Ruins toward the end of the game, Alexandros accidentally lets slip that he's never been inside.
	- This causes the Jester to question what his "preparation for the realignment" (why he didn't immediately join you) really was.
	- If pressed, Alexandros reveals that he believes the King is unfit to rule and can only bring about more ruin.
		~ As such, he took the opportunity to coordinate a coup with some of the remaining wizards.
		~ He urges the party to take his side and agree to dethrone the King once the realignment is complete.
83. Create a wall sprite for behind the throne.
	- Make it be a shield and/or crest with two crossed spears behind it.
84. Oubliette sprites needed
	- Stacked books, from the floor
	- Piles of scrolls on tabletops
	- Tables, chairs
	- Candles/Candelabras
	- Wall-mounted lanterns
	- Grates to drain blood
	- Torture devices (iron maiden, stretching rack)
	- Coffin with its lid ajar (the origin of the player's body)
	- Blood stained walls/floors
	- Dirt stained walls/floors
	- Wizard sprites
85. Design a Logo and the logo screen
	- Allow it to be skipped by pressing A in the case of rapidly restarting the game. It's a Quality of Life thing.
86. Create a gif to the README that demonstrates some of the basic gameplay and/or screens in the game.
87. Figure out how to do scene transitions where the screen blacks out in different ways
	- E.g. when trainer battles would start in Pokemon Blue
88. Design the music that plays during the intro (pre-awakening)
	- Inspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEWCCSuHsuQ
	- Incorporate ominous vibes and have the instruments fade in/out
89. To begin learning the GB Studio music software just straight up create a copy of a song you know.
	- This doesn't have to be included in the final game, just listen to something and reverse engineer it for the skill.
	- Try a number of things and genres to get a feel for what you can easily create and what works well with the vibes you're creating.
91. Select roughly how many screens you want the game to be.
	- This will help determine the overall size of the world and the distance between locations.
92. Color the avatar sprites with different pallettes to separate them from one another even more. Color the characters' sprites to match.
93. Create sprites to handle parrying and dodge rolling?
	- Jumping?
94. Create a logo for yourself
	- Come up with a name for it
95. Add cycling through the logos on game launch
	- One for yourself, one for GB Studio
	- Allow skipping them one-by-one with any button press (for QoL)
96. Pan to the Game's title (have the text enter the screen from the top)
	- Then fade in, or slide in the text "Press any button"
97. Decide on some color schemes for the entire game
	- Mainly design a number of reusable palletes for various entities
	- Select core colors that you want for things
	- What tint should the UI be?
	- What colors should each of the 4 main characters be?
		~ Aylmera = Orange?
		~ Jester = Purple?
		~ Neera = Yellow?
		~ Alexandros = Blue?
	- What is the main color of each core story zone?
98. Color interactable objects differently from their backgrounds to make it obvious they're interactable.
99. Make a door sprite for a spiral staircase (a la Golden Sun)
	- Can give the illusion of moving vertically in space between maps

* What if the final battle was between whichever characters you're aligned with?
	- Could be all of your party against the King.
	- Or the Jester + King against the rest of the party.
	- Or the rest of the party against Alexandros and his wizards + bandits.
* Regardless, the final climactic events should occur after the realignment, once you return to the castle itself.


Core Gameplay Loop:
====================
1. Exploring the world and learning lore via:
	- Dialogue with NPCs
	- Reading notes/books/engravings
	- Noting the history of areas and what events led to their current states
2. Deciding what factions you agree with and want to support
	- Answering dialogue choices to pledge loyalty, or wage war
	- Discussing with your party the rationale behind your choices
3. Encountering enemies
	- They patrol around the zone, catching their attention triggers combat
	- Think a mix of pokemon trainers and enemy patrols
	- Could also just have zones (like Tall grass in Pkmn) where encounters can randomly occur
4. Combat
	- JRPG style combat
	- Party encounters enemy parties and fights with a mixture of single target and multi-target attacks.
		~ Easiest way to do multi is to have an attack with a center and adjacent tiles
		~ Or it damages center and one to EITHER the left or right, etc.
All of this builds to the Climax:
	- Player stabilizes the Realm and returns to the King. Based on faction decisions, you fight the King
	and either spare or kill him. 
	- Enstating whichever group/groups you've aligned with previously.
		~ I hate this. I don't want a "you pick the winner" type thing. It's so boring.
		~ I want the player to kill or align with groups throughout the game to get different trade-offs or
		advantages in completing their overall goal (saving the Realm).
		~ Then I want them to return to the King, and either submit (accepting that a King is better than no King) or to kill him (either out of revenge, or through finding him unfit to rule).
		~ Then the game ends, the player does NOT takeover as the new ruler.


Main Antagonists:
=================
1. Abandoned Realm Ranger
	- An archer who was present at the siege of the Great Tower.
	- Having lost faith in the Kingdom's ability to rule the Realm, she now raids their supply lines. 
	- She Feels the Kingdom is undeserving of rule after it poisoned the landscape so wholly.
	- Was absolutely traumatized by her unit fleeing and, then having to slay undead versions of her allies to survive.
	- Controls a tiny band of raiders who seek to usurp and overthrow the King.
	- Lost one of her arms since the Great Explosion.

	- A grassroots leader who rallied disenfranchised soldiers and bandits under one banner.
	- Harasses the local population for supplies to support his otherwise noble goals. Believes it's a justifiable cost for a better future.
2. One-armed warrior?
	- Acquires a second arm made of magic?
	- Could have multiple battles. First time is against them with one arm, second time is once they've acquired a second.
3. Undead Prince
	- Filled with Aetherial rage. Uses a massive 2 handed sword and wears bulky armor.
4. Leper leader
	- Sickly and weak, but very astute and philosophical. Acknowledges the need for change in the Realm's leadership.
	- Accelerationist. Perhaps sees no future for themselves, and by extension wants the same for the rest of the Realm.
5. The Player (kind of)
	- Over the course of the story, the player learns that they are indeed NOT the fabled hero whose stories are littered across the region.
	- The Wizards mistakenly resurrected you, a cousin of that hero (a simple mixup in the many bones of the catacombs).
	- As such, the player learns they were a rebel warlord that broke from the Kingdom and 
	- The Player is not forced to be evil as a result of this, but IS directly playing as someone who once was cruel and bitter.
	- These details are revealed overtime as more lore is learned:
		a. Hero has a birth mark or tattoo that the protagonist doesn't share.
		b. Player has no memory of any of their heroics.
		c. Player should have an anti-affinity to something that the Hero was known for.
			~ e.g. Hero was always known to be physically warm, thought to have fire inside them. Meanwhile, the Player character gets cold in various regions and is freezing at once point.
		d. When given the Hero's fabled sword, it should feel slightly too heavy for you.
6. Vampire Lord
	- Man who is losing control of his flock of followers. Has little interest in assisting the realm, as the undead mostly live him alone, and he's a recluse after all.
	- The party could be forced to enter his manor as a means to escape a growing undead horde they'd attracted.
		~ Then they must navigate the inside and escape.
	- He's inhospitable, though not opening hostile initially.
		~ Has no interesting in feeding on the party, but wouldn't mind them simply being dead (less long-term enemies that way).
	- "I know your ilk, Slayer. You're blessed to have your kills deemed righteous by the Crown. But if you were exiled... how many would still perish?"
	- Although very old, he should still (technically) be younger than the Hero. He makes remarks about this, and how unusual it is.



Dialogue:
==========
Max line length is 39 characters.

1. Oubliette:
--------------
Alexandros: (Surprised)
Ah ha! You're finally awake! If I
hadn't known any better, I would've
woken you from your slumber sooner. 

But it's best not to rush awakening
during revival rituals such as this.
Wait, you can understand me, right?
	Decision:
[Yes]
Alexandros:
Good. I had begun to doubt myself
after so many failed attempts. It's
nice to see my efforts paying off.
[No]
Alexandros:
Funny. But there's really not time
for games. Your revival came at an
opportune moment, we can't waste it.

Alexandros:
You're probably brimming with all sorts
of questions about all this. I don't
even know where to begin...

I don't know what you remember, but 
you're the fabled hero Aylmera. 'Slayer
of Evil' and 'Protector of Antiquity'.

You lived more than a thousand years 
ago, but you DID serve this Realm. You
even saved it from falling into ruin.

I hesitate to say more, but the King
will gladly elaborate further. He
awaits you upstairs. In his throne.

[Talk to Alexandros again]
I'm sure it's a lot to take in, but
everyone here has been through a lot.
We've all... lost things dear to us.		(This is a reference to him losing his mentor, the Mad Wizard, and most of his colleagues/friends during the war.)

But don't let me keep you. The King
can be impatient. Seek him upstairs,
he'll tell you all you need to know.

2. Throne Room
----------------
His Majesty: (Smiling)
Praise the Heavens! You're more 
magnificent than I had even imagined.




Character Names/Titles:
=============================
* Denotes personality traits to assist with writing dialogue.

		- Ultimately, he blames himself for failing to manage his kingdom and failing to protect his heir.
6. Marshall, Prince of the Realm
	- Defender of the Realm

		- Interestingly, many paladins operated as sell-swords, akin to Samurai in Japan. Thus, they fought on both sides of the war.	
		- Once revered as beacons of morality and the will of God, they're now seen as idealogues who threw away their traditional ideals for false hopes.

===============
Follow the main events outlined below. This is just for general reference of the core zones needing to be built.

Order of Main Events:
======================
Music to write to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIX1lWOUaGQ&list=PLw1SQn79wR4Z4an1CBWQPi_UNDdgNDDNU&index=4

1-A. The player is revived in the oubliette and told they're the great warrior Aylmera. Unbeknownst to them, this is not their identity.
	- She wakes up (make animations for this). Alexandros is there and explains a bit of how she got there.
	- He is mostly concerned with himself, and not the player.
		~ He prides himself on being able to revive her to the glory of her youth.
	- Alexandros mentions offhand that it was an experimental ritual.
		~ Though disappointed you don't have your memories, he is unconcerned.
	- Urges the player to bring any questions they have to the King, who is upstairs.
1-B. Aylmera meets with the King upstairs.
	- He warmly greets her. And describes his need of a "legendary hero" for an important quest.
		~ Says its important to the stability of the entire Realm.
		~ Note that he is one of the few non-party characters who accurately sees the significance of the Aether.
	- Prying in just the right way can reveal a moment of humility from him, where he admits he wished he didn't have to revive her.
		~ Poking through his bedroom and notes reveals bits of internal doubt.
		~ It points to a man who understands he's at the end of his life. He's out of time and options. His bloodline can continue, but his kingdom MIGHT be able to.
	- He tells Aylmera to find the Jester in the castle and return to him for the details of her pending journey.
2-A. Searching the castle, Aylmera finds the Jester in the War Room.
	- He greets her warmly as well, but is cynical of the King as his plans.
	- Returning to the King, Aylmera + the Jester are told of their mission to recover the elemental stones.
	- He describes the plan as follows (leaving out many key details the player learns later):
		a. There exist 5 elemental stones which control the balance of elemental energies in the Realm.
		b. Things in the Realm were fine until recently, following conflict in the far East, one of these stones was shattered, upsetting the balance.
			~ (He doesn't elaborate as to why this happened. Or in what capacity.)
		c. You are to find the 4 remaining stones, take them to a ritual site in the East, and shatter them to release (and restore balance) to the elements.
		d. He knows of 2 leads for the locations of these stones:
			~ The first was hidden by his soldiers several decades ago in a now-ruined city's catacombs (to the far Northwest).
				~ It was specifically hidden alongside the remains of one of his ancestors. It should still be there now.
			~ The second is in possession of an allied Kingdom to the North.
		e. He has just sent Alexandros, alone, to fetch the one in the North and expects Aylmera and the Jester to get the one from the Catacombs of Antiquity.
			~ The Northern region is ruled by a Lord loyal to the Realm. The King is confident in the Lord's cooperation.
		f. Once you have fetched the first stone, you are to rendezvous with Alexandros and continue locating the other stones.
	- This is much different from the plan the Jester thought they were doing.
		~ The Jester is taken aback, he didn't know he was going to personally carry out the mission.
		~ Moreover, he thought that Alexandros would be accompanying Aylmera, not going on such a long journey alone.
		~ Despite his disagreements and protests, the King insists on this plan, souring things for them both.
			~ It should seem apparent that they're not being fully honest with you. But neither volunteer more information.
	- The Jester slyly criticizes the King's wishes before heading off.
		~ The King and the Jester have a close relationship, but are often critical of one another. (Think of two old best friends or rivals.)
	- The King also notes that they should get geared at the Armory before leaving (an optional task).
2-B. (Optional) Aylmera visits the Armory/Barracks for some initial gear.
	- Inside, a Commander greets her coldly, but outfits her with the best sword he can (a meager one).
	- It's a greatsword, her staple weapon, and she has no idea how to wield it. He stops her from swining it so as to not hurt herself.
	- "What the hell are you doing? Haven't you swung a greatsword before?"
	- He points out that (as in real life) When gripping a greatsword: The top hand pushes, while the bottom hand pulls.
		~ Could tie this into a simple tutorial for the player about how to use their skills.
		~ Regardless, make this quick and painless for the player, don't drone on and on about controls.
3. Aylmera and the Jester leave the castle and enter into the surrounding city's ruins. It's full of scared peasantry.
	- Soldiers are spread thin and acknowledge they can't protect much more than the castle itself. Much of the city is left to its own devices.
	- Inside the castle, nobility is only concerned with the prior war (anti-mage sentiment) and the minor inconveniences of their lives.
		~ Chiefly, they complain about food and wine rations.
		~ And they feel all safety measures about the castle are overreactions by the soldiers.
		~ This is because many of the soldiers (at least those in command) saw the Aether frenzy, whereas the nobles have not.
	- Commoners are fearful of the roving banditry and wish the castle would open its gates to them.
		~ There are also whispers of undead creatures stalking in the night, but there isn't much concrete evidence.
			~ Aylmera can ask the Jester about these roving undead.
			~ The peasantry believes it to be divine punishment for the King's pride. And the sacrifice of his son.
		~ People who insult the King often face verbal backlash from the Jester. Despite their differences, the two are good friends.
4. Begin heading West through the surrounding farmland, sticking to the main road, while being mindful of the bandits.
	- Begin hearing rumors about the banditry planning something big.
5. Find many farmsteads destroyed or abandoned. Those that remain are powerless to protect themselves.
	- Some live day-to-day and hope neither the undead nor the bandits kill them.
		~ "I fear the undead most of all. A bandit can be negotiated with."
	- Others have given up, spending their days drinking as they feel the end is near, so what's the point any more?
	- The pubs are full, but hardly jovial. They have a more depressed aire to them.
6. Aylmera and crew make their way through the farmland outskirts and into the Forest. This is bandit territory and they fight their way deep inside.
	- Forced to take this route, as other pathways (e.g. bridges) have been sabotaged by the bandits.
		~ Perhaps a bridge is kept raised by people on the other side of the river for fear of the bandits.
		~ As such, when the bandits are defeated, this bridge can be lowered (for faster travel to older zones).
		~ And this allows, narratively, other characters to more easily move around the world (e.g. the Bard and his circus).
	- Encounter some traveling merchants and minstrels (circus) stuck on the way. Perhaps a bard that's recurring periodically through the plot.
	- Some of the bandits can be conversed with, to reveal that they (at least claim) to want to support the peasantry.
		~ They oppose the Crown and seek a regime change, but steal from the peasants for resources.
		~ Though they claim to wish to uplift everyone when in power, they have yet to do any of it. No praxis, eh?
7. At the heart of the forest (in a clearing) is the bandit camp. A circle of caravan wagons. It's here they encounter the bandit leader.
	- She wears a hood and has long, shoulder length hair. Notably, she has only one arm. Her right arm. Vivian, the one-armed ranger.
	- Before engaging the party in battle, she just has a large poncho over herself, only after conversing does she open it up, revealing that she only has one arm.
		~ "It's rare for someone to enter our camp uninvited. Judging by the amount of trouble you've been causing, I was certain there were more than two of you." Vivian sneers.
		~ "We only want to pass through. We're here on behalf of the Realm." Aylmera replies.
		~ "And which Realm is it that you serve? The one that's out in the fields working themselves to death. Or the one who sits idly atop a throne?" - Vivian
		~ "The Realm encompasses everyone. Even the poor saps you rip off daily." the Jester chimes in.
		~ "As if the Crown doesn't pillage this land for his own benefit. Only when he does it, the law is on his side. You're Aether-maddened if you can't see that." - Vivian
	- Vivian is a former ranger of the Realm who was present at the Great Explosion. She wishes to overthrow the king and is using the elemental stone as leverage.
		~ "Jester, you intrigue me. You know what my comrades told me? That you were at the explosion. Same as many of us. You saw the chaos, the death... the pain. And yet you still ran back to that wretched King for protection." - Vivian
		~ "I admit, I snorted when I first heard it. Couldn't believe it. Even for a fool, that's pretty dumb." - Vivian laughs
		~ The Jester gets visible frustrated. (Angry or nervous or sad emote)
		~ "As if you could have foretold what would happen! And what are you doing to remedy it? Warring with the peasantry?!" - The Jester
		~ "How do you know these people? What explosion is she talking about?" - Aylmera
		~ "Huh? What goddamn rock have you been living under? THE explosion. The Great one! The one that sent shockwaves out across the entire realm?!" - Vivian
		~ Aylmera is visibly confused (''...'' emote)
		~ "I hate you fucking nobles. Bet you were too drunk to even notice the earth rumbling beneath your feet. Well. I'll never forget it. I'm not allowed to." - Vivian
		~ Vivian throws her poncho open, revealing her lack of an arm.
		~ "Look at me! A world-class ranger, reduced to a cripple in an instant. And for what? Some royal's pursuit of ego." - Vivian shouts, sighing.
		~ "But in the aftermath of that explosion, I found my true companions. Those who stayed behind, rescuing survivors and fending off the damned." - Vivian
		~ "So, after returning home, when the Crown closed his gates to us, I knew where things stood." - Vivian
		~ "Though he sits atop a throne, its foundation is built on ash and blood. Even Morcant couldn't rectify such a thing." - Vivian
	- Vivian suddenly fires the first shot (a crossbow bolt) that collides with the player sprite, triggering the battle scene.
	- Vivian should use a crossbow (one-handed) during her fight.
		~ She should also summon bandits to assist her in some way during the fight.
8-A. Aylmera defeats Vivian, but Vivian is able to escape in a smokescreen (from a smokebomb) before she is defeated.
	- Due to her quick getaway, Vivian drops the first of the elemental stones (Fire).
	- Most of the bandits clear out, through fear. Maybe a few on the outskirts are left? Bitter toward you, but non-violent.
	- The stray bandits can mention how they heard stories of Aylmera's heroism. But that they don't see any of that now. It must've been lies.
8-B. The player is given a chance to ask the Jester about what Vivian mentioned. (Notably, he leaves OUT any details of himself having seen the undead and knowing they're real.)
	- [You wanna fill me in on what she was talking about?] - Aylmera
	- "No. There's not much to say." - the Jester
	- "I sincerely doubt that." - Aylmera
	- "The King decided it best to not smother you in details. It's important you recognize the importance of your, OUR mission." - the Jester
	- "You're still keeping me in the dark." - Aylmera
	- The jester frowns reluctantly.
	- "Alright. I suppose the Crown isn't here to protest anyhow. Where to even begin..." - the Jester thinks for a moment. ('...' emote)
		~ Have the Jester pace off from Aylmera during this, narrating his account of the war so far.
	- "Before your revival, conflict broke out in the Kingdom. A civil war about autonomy and leadership. On one side was the Crown with his royal armies. And on the other was the bulk of the royal wizardry, led by a... Mad Wizard."
	- 1. [Wizards? Like Alexandros?] or 2. [Mad Wizard? You mean he was insane?] - Aylmera
		1. "Yes, Alexandros himself even fought against us during the final months of the conflict. Though that was some years ago. Things were much different then. More volatile." - the Jester
			~ "For what it's worth, he's received a royal pardon now. And you'd be wise to remember that without him, you'd only be a pile of bones." - the Jester
		2. "Oh absolutely. Most wizards even agree on that point. I can't speak to his charisma, but their loyalties were sincere. A handful still believe in his cause." - the Jester
	- "Well, by the looks of things I'm guessing the Crown emerged victorious." - Aylmera
	- "Hahaha! Hardly a victory. Thousands dead, his armies destroyed and his throne... heirless." the Jester laughs to himself before getting quiet.
	- "Look, I'm a fool. I've made a life out of seeing humor where there is often only sadness. But make no mistake: That war brought us NOTHING but ruination." - the Jester trails off. ('...' emote?)
	- "And the 'explosion' that Vivian mentioned? You witnessed it?" - Aylmera
	- "Yes. I was at the forward base camp when it happened. Just outside the blast. I distinctly remember the swirl of blue flames erupting from the Tower, illuminating the night." - the Jester
	- "And then just as suddenly, it all came crashing down. A hail of stone and suffocating ash. Everyone inside was killed almost instantly. As were many outside." - the Jester
9. Aylmera and the Jester continue out the other side of the forest toward the ruins of a nearby city. Where they know the Crown hid one of the stones.
10. The typical path is blocked by debris from a landslide. As such, they're forced to go through a lesser-traveled tunnel.
	- Inside, a hermitish Nomad is encountered at their fire. They can be talked with to reveal some of their story.
	- He reveals that in his youth he could smell the "presence of death, the mark of a killer" on travelers.
	- He used it to save his village as a child, and was revered for this skill. A skill which he is (presumed) to no longer possess as an old man.
	- He bids them well as they part ways with him.
11. Aylmera and crew make it through the tunnel and arrive at the ruined city. To their surprise, there's a small colony of people living in its outskirts: Lepers.
	- Asking around for directions and info, the locals reveal that they knew of Aylmera's arrival. A visiting Priestess told them so.
	- Ultimately, they want nothing to do with the Crown or the Realm. They've been abandoned and have problems of their own.
	- They do have a de-facto leader who they admire for his empathy and strong will.
		~ They mention how he's an Apothecary who makes potions to ease their burden and pain.
12. Within the encampment, they find Neera (the priestess)
	- She informs Aylmera and crew of their Divine journey and her need to accompany them.
	- The Jester doubts her ability to commune with God (after she explains the hivemind that speaks to her in many, varied tongues).
	- She proves her connection to the Divine by mentioning that she knows of Alexandros' mission to reach the Lord.
		~ Moreover, she reveals that he will soon be in danger. She convinces them to let her join, as she's vital to their success.
		~ "I've seen visions of your journey a thousand different ways. Only when I'm alongside you do you even make it to the end."
13. Aylmera and crew venture further into the heart of the ruined city (in search of the catacombs entrance). Instead, they find the Apothecary.
	- Aylmera and crew meet him and he attempts to stress the importance of empathy.
		~ They don't really have time for his ramblings/teachings. And largely ignore him.
	- He seems like a Salesman, a con artist.
	- When they mention their purpose, he says he's been to the catacombs himself.
		~ Gets defensive, says he's seen nothing worth taking inside and advises they leave it be.
14. Aylmera and crew eventually make their way through the remnants of the city and into its old catacombs.
	- At the entrance is a statue to Aylmera, recognizing her commitment to protecting 'antiquity' from when she defended similar catacombs from necromancer pillaging during her lifetime.
	- The entire party acknowledges that it looks nothing like the player character. They shrug it off as some sort of error by historians.
15. Fighting through the catacombs, they defeat a large monster and then search the tombs where the King specified. However they find nothing.
	- They decide to search the Leper encampment for any clue of its whereabouts.
		~ They also suspect foul play from the Apothecary since he said he'd been inside before.
16. At the outskirts of the Leper encampment (toward the catacombs), Aylmera and crew are again approached by the Apothecary.
	- He reveals that he took the elemental stone a while ago, and gave it to the lepers for safekeeping. 
	- He urges the group to stop assisting the Crown.
	- "I thought the creatures below would be enough of a deterrent. Can't you see your success will only spell ruin for the rest of us?"
	- "Look at how that 'leader' treats his people. This city was forgotten and its people cursed. He's unfit to rule."
17. The Apothecary blocks their path and forces them to fight him in order to proceed.
18. Returning to the Leper encampment, Aylmera and crew are surrounded by the townsfolk.
	- They seem to know that the Apothecary is dead, since he isn't alongside your party.
	- "He warned us it would come to this. That you might not listen to reason. We swore to him we'd stop you if he couldn't."
	- They are weak and easily defeated, but must be killed enmasse to proceed.
	- The Priestess notes how her God thanks them for easing the suffering of the Lepers (through death).
		~ This creeps out the Jester who still has qualms about killing so many sickly people.
	- Only the shopkeeper remains alive (as he decides not to fight).
		~ "They died. And for what? Ideals which will be buried alongside them... Show me your gold."
19. Aylmera and crew proceed along the mountaintops toward the North-eastern city belonging to the Lord and his army.
	- They once again encounter the hermit along the way.
	- Yet again he invites them to chat beside him at his campfire.
	- He reveals that despite his gift, he was unable to save his village. A killer infiltrated them under the guise of a victim, and wiped most of them out.
		~ He blames himself for ignoring the stench of death that was so potent. Because he believed so wholly in the young man's innocent appearance.
	- Apologizes for troubling Aylmera and crew, then goes silent.
20. Aylmera and crew get up to leave, but as they walk away the Hermit rises and throws a dagger in their direction.
	- "I'm sorry. But I can't let myself make that mistake again. Your scent... it's identical. When you approached, all the memories rushed to me so VIVIDLY!
		~ He charges them and engages in a battle.
		~ Music Inspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeANouMyfnQ (the way this begins)
21. Upon defeating the Hermit, he exclaims, "I didn't last... but your foul odor will..." before collapsing and dying.
	- The Jester is again disturbed by this encounter. 
	- The Priestess doesn't seem to mind.
	- Worrying that things are getting more and more out of hand, the Jester urges you to meet up with Alexandros ASAP.
22. Continuing through the mountaintops, Aylmera and crew eventually arrive at a valley in the highlands and reach the outskirts of the Lord's lands.
23. They make their way through the farmland toward the Lord's castle/keep.
	- Due to its distance from the Aether Ruins, things here are more peaceful. Farmers go about their days, and soldiers periodically roam the outskirts actually patrolling the entire area.
	- The crew is not immediately recognized as serving the Crown, and are instead briefly interrogated at the castle's wall about who they are and why they're there.
24. Aylmera and crew accidentally reveal too much about who they are (serving the Crown alongside the mages) and are met with battle.
	- Can be done in a few ways, either mentioning that Aylmera was necromanced, saying Alexandros' name, or intentionally revealing they're with the Crown.
		~ Note that up to this point the King said the Lord was on his side. Whereas Neera hinted that Alexandros is in danger.
25. One of the guards runs away, screaming for help. The crew's cover is blown.
	- While most of the guards fight, one of them runs off (either before or after the encounter).
26. Aylmera and crew must fight their way through waves of soldiers as they cut a path to the throne room of the Lord.
	- "A thousand gold for whoever puts that bitch's head on a spike!"
27. Arriving in the Throne Room, the crew finds Alexandros bound and beaten, alongside the Lord himself.
28. Now aware of who they are, the Lord taunts them.
	- "Well now, the Crown sent you rats to do his dirty work. You must prefer his Chaos to my Order."
	- "I've already spent plenty of time with your friend here." *smiles* "Wasn't much of a conversationalist at first. These magicians boast of their strength, but many are so fragile."
	- He discusses with the player how the Crown can only lead them to further ruin, as he did in the war.
		~ Moreover, he displays his disgust for Alexandros and all mages like him. He views necromancers and their sympathizers as having revoked their humanity.
	- "The Great Hero Aylmera... What wretched misery they've subjugated your flesh. If you weren't an undead abomination, I'd pity you. Your existence is nothing short of sin itself."
29. The Lord reveals he has one of the stones, but refuses to give it to the party as long as they serve the Crown.
	- The Lord kicks Alexandros' shackled body down the stairs of his throne, toward Aylmera and crew.
	- Aylmera and crew catch his rolling body and unbind his hands/mouth.
		~ Aylmera: "Are you alright?"
		  Alexandros: "... *eyes closed* ..."
		  Priestess: "He's covered in cuts and bruises..."
		  Alexandros: "... Help me... Help me..." "Kill. That. BASTARD!!!"
		~ Music Inspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6cnKWFaAOM (Just the introduction, the high notes)
	- Alexandros immediately jumps up, charging up the stairs toward the Lord, beginning an engagement.
		~ The engagement starts with Alexandros immediately getting a free hit onto the Lord.
		~ Immediately after his hit, have a prompt stating: "Alexandros looks beyond furious. His palms are enveloped in white-hot flames."
		~ If possible, have his anger translate into some Double damage or something for the engagement.
		~ Alexandros also starts the fight at half health.
30. Once the Lord is killed, Aylmera and crew pick up his stone (the 3rd stone). And begin walking out of the castle.
	- The few remaining soldiers they encounter back away and run.
	- Even the townsfolk fear them. Some plead for their lives, despite not being in any danger.
	- Most lie bloodied and beaten, huddled in piles as they attempt triage.
31. Leaving the city, Aylmera and crew follow the nearby river downhill (descending the mountain) toward the East.
	- Along the way, they encounter one of the Lord's soldiers contemplating a stretch of the riverbank with thousands of flowers on either side.
	- He tells them how he remembers the War with the wizards.
		~ How he lost many friends at this very spot.
		~ How the river ran red with the blood of so many soldiers.
	- He laments that it was all in vain. That in the end, leaders only wish to rule, even if its over ashes.
		~ He notes that these beautiful flowers aren't ruled by anyone, and they're the most precious thing of all.
		~ He refuses to fight Aylmera and crew.
	- "How far down this path must you travel, before you know where it leads?"
	- "If you don't see it now, then certainly you must be blind."
	- (Optional) Perhaps he ambiently wishes/prays for death, but if engaged in combat he fights to the bitter end.
		~ This is because he's still holding on to something. You aren't meant to know what.
32. Aylmera and crew cross through a foggy marshland, where much of the land has, recently, sunk into the earth.
	- As such, the undead are thinner here than elsewhere. The area feels eerie and devoid of life.
33. They encounter a witch's hut deep in the heart of the swamp. She invites them inside and is hospitable.
	- Player progression is blocked by something (perhaps she has an animal in the way outside her hut?) until speaking with her.
	- Through discussions she reveals that she knows the player is undead. She then offers a spiritual reading.
	- She drugs the protagonist without their knowledge (lacing other food/drink), and uses their dazed state to extract information.
	- Ultimately, what she reveals is that the player does not have hero's blood. 
		~ That they have a dark history. That they carry the weight of many ruthless kills from their previous life.
34. Aylmera and crew arrive at the Ramparts leading to the Aether Ruins
	- It's a patchwork of booby-traps. It's dangerous and full of numerous traps, which effectively act as landmines.
	- After the Wizards blew a hole in it, and the Realm lacked enough soldiers to defend it in its entirety, both sides booby-trapped it and its surrounding areas.
	- As such, it's long been regarded as a no-man's land. One perk is it prevents the undead horde from easily spilling through the hole.
35. Finding their way through, they arrive at the Ruins of Aether and make their way to the wreckage of the Tower.
	- Lots of powerful soldiers (now dead and/or possessed by aether) wander around as hostile husks.
	- A mixture of both undead wizards and undead realm soldiers are encountered here.
36. At the base of the Tower Ruins, they encounter the Undead Prince. An aether-husked corpse wandering aimlessly.
	- Note: Hardly a single floor of the Tower remains. It has almost been completely leveled.
	- The Jester immediately recognizes him and is horrified. His memories of the explosion rush back to him all at once.
	- The Jester is frozen by both shock and fear. He simulatenously wants to call out to the Prince, but also knows to fear him for the monster he has become.
		~ Perhaps the other party members are trying to run, and encourage the others to do so, but the Jester's shock forces them to stay and fight. (as Morcant closes the distance)
	- The Prince notices the party and approaches. He's slightly more lucid than other undead. Muttering to himself as he engages the party.
		~ "Bastards..."
		~ "Can't run now..."
		~ "For the King..."
37. After a brutal fight, the party slays the Prince.
	- The Jester is distraught, he breaks down into tears. The player and party console him.
	- The Priestess offers to say a few words, his last rites, as they stand before his hulking corpse.
		~ "You fought valiantly, both in life and undeath. May your soul return to the peace of the unknown. Just as your bones will turn to dust."
38. Collecting themselves for a moment, the party readies to enter the basement ruins of the Tower.
	- Inside is a maze of magical traps, old and new.
	- Examining the design of the rooms and the symbols carved into the walls, they determine their goal:
		~ They must replace each of the 4 stones into its appropriate elemental slot.
		~ Something like one in each cardinal direction, or 3 in cardinal directions and the last at the center of them all.
	- The whole time, the party feels that something is off. As though they're being watched. As though a spirit is present.
	- There is also, notably, an ancient skeleton dead in the main chamber. The only one. (the real Aylmera's body)
		~ Might be a bit TOO much detail. Does it even make sense that no one has been here for like a thousand years to clean up her body?
39. Once all the stones are placed, they must go into the main chamber and perform a ritual that Alexandros has studied prior.
	- As they begin the rebalancing ritual, they are disrupted by a spirit. The spirit of the real Aylmera.
	- She shouts at them, as a banshee would screech, halting their progress.
		~ She states who she is, and demands to know what they are trying to accomplish.
	- Upon hearing the name 'Aylmera' the whole party (protagonist included) are astounded.
		~ They tell Aylmera (the spirit) that their party leader is the reincarnation of her.
		~ "You bear neither my soul nor my flesh, and yet you use my name. Who are you?" (the player does not know)
		~ "Strange. You reek of death and yet have an air of nobility." - Spirit of Aylmera
		~ "You wear my armor and wield my sword, yet you are not me." "Do you wish to mock me?" - Spirit of Aylmera
	- Alexandros realizes he must have retrieved the incorrect corpse from the royal catacombs. But is perplexed, because the body they took was buried alongside her unique armor.
		~ The tomb even bore her name.
		~ "This was the body labeled 'The hero of antiquity', the one who died protecting the catacombs from raiders."
	- The spirit of Aylmera reveals that she didn't die as the "hero of antiquity" like people thought.
		~ She was cornered in the royal catacombs by a rival army (seeking to pillage the catacombs).
		~ Finding herself cornered inside, she slayed some soldiers, swapped into their armor and then fled through their lines.
		~ Realizing (or knowing) that the goals of that army were to destabilize the natural balance of elements, Aylmera decided to travel undercover to the Tower's Basement.
		~ Stealth being so key to her success, and time not being on her side, she neglected to inform the Kingdom of her plans.
	- She succeeded in her mission, making it to the basement, but was sealed inside when she triggered a trap.
		~ As such, her soul (and corpse) have remained trapped inside.
	- As such, the player Aylmera is simply a nameless soldier. Revived without any memories of who they once were.
		~ But they've proven themselves, and the real Aylmera is impressed by their commitment to save the Realm.
		~ "If you truly wish to save the Realm, let me guide you."
40. Ultimately, the spirit of Aylmera warns them that the ritual they're attempting will shatter ALL of the stones, unleashing even more chaotic energies into the land.
	- Alexandros realizes the evil nature of the ritual.
		~ He also notes that his notes on the matter came from the Mad Wizard, who had begun training the mages in it.
		~ He wonders whether the Mad Wizard knew of its destructive nature all along.
	- The party is ultimately urged by the Spirit of Aylmera to abandon the ritual, recognizing that the stones must be left alone and protected in the Tower basement.
	- Instead, she guides them on how to restore the Aether crystal.
		~ "Warrior, I know not your name and neither do you. But you've earned the title, 'Hero of Antiquity'. Bear it proudly. You carry yourself with great nobility." - the Spirit of Aylmera
41. The Spirit is disappointed to find that the Aether crystal has been shattered.
	- She realizes that the party must undergo a final leg of their quest in order to repair it and restore order to the Realm.
	- "You. Cannot. Fail. Too much lies at stake. And far too many have died for you to perish at the last step."
	- "You will need to combine the shattered stone with the bones of the blessed."
	- "It will be difficult, since most these catacombs have been defiled. You'll need to find consecrated ground beneath which someone is buried."
	- "I'm afraid that's as much as I can offer. I know not where you can find such a place."
42. The party leaves the Basement Ruins and talks amongst themselves above-ground about possible leads.
	a. Return to the field of Red flowers
		- Attempting to dig up any of the bodies will anger the grieving soldier, triggering combat.
			~ But he does drop a strong weapon for the party to wield.
		- Moreover, you'll find that combining these bones fails to restore the stone.


XX. Figure out what that final step is. Where they need to go, and how they need to return to the Aether Ruins.
	- How about having to fuse it with the bones of a pure, innocent person.
	- Basically, they have to dig up the Queen and defile her corpse in order to restore the stone.
	- *Everyone disliked that*. The party should HATE that they have to do this.

XX. Still need a way to get the 4th elemental stone (which isn't Aether)
	- Perhaps the King has been safeguarding it himself, and personally hands it to you?
XX. Aylmera and crew arrive at the Queen's grave.
	- What is significant here? Perhaps she died in childbirth. Her gravestone could read: "She sacrificed all she had for the continuation of the Realm. May her soul rest easy knowing we'll protect her dream, just as she protected ours."
XX. How did the King come to power?
	- Did he ascend the Throne by blood, or did he steal it from someone else? This could add more depth to his character.
XX. The player can kill the King.
	- *Smiles* "My kingdom died well before you dealt the deathknell..." "If I might have... one request... protect the Realm..." - The King's dying words
XX. (Alternate) Killing the King.
	- The entire party (especially the Jester) attempt to convince the King to step down. To allow a more competent ruler to take his place.
	- The King's ignorance and bull-headed nature prevents him from seeing reason, and so the player must kill him.
		~ He's a feeble old man, who dies easily. Pitifully, even. The player should feel bad about this, despite it being the correct call to make.
XX. Player enters a mansion that is overrun by undead (or they're barricaded outside at the door)
	- Must race against time to get reprieve from them.
	- Perhaps after slaying the armies of the Lord, the undead flood in to the now weakened zone.
XX. At some point, the Leper Leader should be revealed to be largely a con artist and huckster.
	- Although he does believe in providing them peace-of-mind, he's 100% aware that his medicines are placebo.
	- He also uses them to accumulate wealth and luxuries for himself.

The more I think on it, it's non-sensical for the King to be revealed as evil. But he is someone that needs to step down, even by death if necessary. He's a tragic sort.


Ideas for Conflict/Intrigue:
=============================
1. What if toward the end of the game you lost party members one at a time (making fights harder) until only the protagonist was left?
2. What if each faction was someone that could be aligned with via dialogue? Avoiding a fight, but then also making a trade-off to ignore their treachery.
	- Having optional bossfights works better with a skill-based combat system (for balancing EXP levels at certain points)
	a. Bandit Leader holds the area's peasants as hostages and serfs. Forced to farm in order to feed his army. Has an interest in ultimately freeing them, but by force.
	b. The Lord/Liege is extremely cruel and uses torture against his enemies, but maintains order in his lands.
		~ Could perhaps employ a Miniboss ("The Butcher") who is truly monstrous. But kept around for his loyalty and the order he creates, despite his immoral and despicable tendencies.
	c. The leader of the lepers (a snake-oil salesman) enjoys his position of authority and wealth/luxury from their loyalty. Acknowledges he sells them lies and placebo, but it does truly put their minds at rest their burdens.
		~ They admire him, but when cornered one-on-one he admits that he knows his recipes and 
		~ Perhaps he's an Apothecary selling them "healing" potions and ointments? Could use poisons/flasks against the player in battle.
	d. The Witch seeks to enlighten the player to things they don't know (and she suspects), but does so by drugging and entrancing them. Has no regard for the will of others.
		~ Perhaps she should even have skeletal (or undead) slaves that tend to her needs. Disregarding the people whose souls used to inhabit their flesh.
	e. The Undead Prince. An unreasonable beast, driven mad with the Aether flowing through him. He rambles to himself, and fails to recognize anyone he once knew.
		~ He should maintain an odd level of lucidity. Rather than a Frankenstein's monster, he's a mindless, perfectionist killer. Like a fencer perfecting each strike, but no longer able to understand the meaning/cost of death.
	f. The King wishes for a strong kingdom, but is unable to create it during his entire life. Instead he is driven by revenge and a lust for power. This comes at the cost of everyone in the Realm, his enemies and allies alike.


Concepts:
==========
1. "Don't fear what you don't know."
2. "Humility above all else."
3. "Treachery begets treachery."
4. "Cowardice reveals one's innermost doubts."
5. "Never engage in a fair fight."
6. "Few wars, if any, are just."
7. "I feel dead inside and I am alone anyway."
8. "I am a product of my environment."
9. Player party has assassins sent after them, and is opposed by almost all other governing bodies (aside from the King).
	- A scene where the party is rolled up on by mounted assassins who just immediately attack could be very cool.
10. Player must kill the Leper colony in order to take their elemental orb.
	- Literally kill them ALL. (Some directly, others are assumed to die in the wake left behind.)
	- They're peaceful and just off on their own, trying to survive. Wanting nothing to do with the politics of the Realm (which has long abandoned them).
11. "Old World ideas cannot flourish or succeed in the harsh reality of the New World."
12. "When killing everyone, does it even make sense to spare anyone?"
13. Swearing fealty to the King or not.
14. What if it had a Synthwave chiptune soundtrack?
	https://watchoutforsnakestheband.bandcamp.com/album/dis-integrate
		- Whole album is good, but Time (Never Enough) is esp. good energy
	https://samaleums.bandcamp.com/album/enter-the-megadungeon
15. Player is ambushed by a bossfight by a boss riding in on horseback out of nowhere and triggering the fight.
16. "Hope is the only form of survival"
17. "Workers yearning to build"
18. Lightning starting fires at unprecedented rates
19. Rivers running red with blood during a battle, which left behind a now beautiful stretch of flowers.
20. Deciding whether to slay or spare enemies after fighting them in a JRPG battle.
	- Could have some characters ask for death. For honor, or because their armies are already decimated by you.
	- Others could beg for life.
	- Options could be "Converse" or "Kill" when interacting with them post battle.
		~ Or "Slay" vs "Spare"
21. The Jester and the King should have a goofy dynamic.
	- "This is my funny little emotional support guy."
22. How historians are unable to know of the intricate social details of people during their actual lives.
23. "People become resistant to predation when they feel safe." (The opposite is also true.)
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8St36RjHd2E @ 38:39
24. A "Check-in" system for periodically talking to your party members. Allows you to talk with them and learn more about who they are and their histories.
	- Could occur manually in menus. Could occur auotmatically at savepoints?
25. "There are no heroes. Everyone has a skeleton... or two."
26. What if there were simulated "loading screens" of doors opening like in Resident evil for major zones?
	- Could easily just destroy the pace and feel sluggish, but could be worth the experimentation.
27. "When starving, everyone will fight over the crumbs. No matter how meek or feeble."
28. Near the end of the game, you fight the spirit of the real Aylmera?
	- Maybe that's too complicated. But being visited by the voice of, or visions of, Aylmera might be cool.
	- "You wear my armor and wield my sword, yet you are not me." "Do you wish to mock me?"
29. Quotes from the Priestess on her God: "God comes to me in many forms. Sometimes as the wind, or as a voice. Rather, as many voices. Sometimes all at once."
	- "There are times when I hear nothing from him for days. And others where he talks nonstop for hours on end."
	- "It's rare for him to hear me, but I'm content listening to him. He has so much to share. I'm privileged by his enlightenment."
30. When the Spirit of Aylmera is revealed to the Player, the Priestess recognizes her voice as one of the many that God has spoken to her through.
	- As such, the Priestess feels it's a good omen, and is eager to hear the spirit out.
31. "The `Great War`? Nothing great about it. A lot of pain, and even more bodies we had to bury. Didn't even have a chance to celebrate our meager victory."
32. When encountering Marshall, the undead Prince
	- Prince: "To create... is to... consume..."
		~ Alexandros recognizes this as a phrase that Mad Wizard frequently spoke. He's horrified/perplexed why Marshall's remains know/speak it.
		~ It's likely one of the last phrases uttered by the Mad Wizard before his inevitable demise.
33. Asking Alexandros why he served the Mad Wizard if the Mad Wizard was such a chaotic man.
	- Alexandros, smiling longingly:
		"Everyone only remembers him for the Great Explosion. Even what's left of us wizards remember him as such."
		"But to be in his presence, and to see what I saw first-hand. He was a miracle-worker."
		"Though I can't speak to his... mental faculties, he seemed attuned with nature in a way I fail to understand. He was connected to something bigger."
		"Spying on him one evening, I watched as he, using magic alone, grew a single seed into a magnificent sapling."
		"I watched intently as its branches sprawled upward higher and higher touching the ceiling until a canopy formed over the entire room."
		"And just as it seemed it would engulf everything, he stopped it. Then used that same magic to reverse its growth and returned it all back into that seed."
		"He was crying while he did it. Tears of joy. Smiling and laughing to himself as he worked."
		"No one in the Realm would agree with me, but I often wonder..."
		"Knowing what energies would be released in that blast, he still chose to trade it for all those peoples' lives."
		"If he killed all those soldiers... all of us wizards... maybe he saw something we didn't?"
		"I can only guess what other world would have instead awaited us. But who's to say it's a better one than this?"
34. Asking the Jester about his relationship with the King
	- TBD. They are friends, he truly cares about the King.
35. Asking the Priestess about what precisely she sees in the future
	- Neera, curtly:
	"I don't see the future all at once, God does not make me privy to such things."
	"I wonder if even he has such powers himself..."
	"No, instead he offers me guidance. His voices tell me things, and each one shows a different path."
	[Do they ever lie?]
	Neera, laughing:
	"Certainly, some are real troublemakers. God has a beautiful sense of humor."
	"But I've learned to understand his humor, and know which of his voices are sincere."
	[Voices? Plural?]
	Neera:
	"Yes. He speaks to me with many different tongues. But all have his intentions behind them."
	"Many times they speak all at once. I've trained myself to selectively listen to the voices behind his words."
	"A scholar once described it as a 'Hivemind' of sorts. If God is like a bee, then I am happily his keeper."
	"The honeys he produces for me are bountiful. They have yet to lead me astray."
	[More than bees live in hives...]	(Available after her beekeeper line)
	Neera, lightly rebuffed:
	"You mean to imply he works as a wasp? Or perhaps a colony of molerats?"
	"Though you mean to besmirch his methods, they are sound."
	"A hive knows the value of community and working toward a collective goal."
	"Perhaps our discussion is meant as something for you to ponder."
36. The player should walk past Old Scratch (ignoring him) after a while, but he still poses questions that (can) force a response from the player.
	- Alternately, give the player the option to ignore him (repeatedly).
	- Would love if I could animate him leaning and smoking.
37. Attempting to attack Old Scratch after he asks an incredibly rude question about your morality
	- Old Scratch, with a devilish grin:
	"Easy, pal. It was only a question. Forget I even brought it up."
38. Invasive questions from Old Scratch
	- Old Scratch (earlier on in the story):
	"Forgive me, but my memory's not as good as it used to be. How many dead is that now? Are we past double-digits?"
	- Old Scratch (after slaying the lepers):
	"Lepers. Even I didn't have the heart to do what you did. Is that why you did it? To feel heroic?"
	- Old Scratch (after killing the King)
	"Heh. You don't disappoint, you know that?"
	[It wasn't for you.]
		"Nevertheless, I still admire your handiwork."
	[You're welcome.]
		"You're quite the splendid one."
	"But. There's something eating away at me, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask..."
	"Why not take the throne? It's waiting for you. A seat ready to be warmed."
	[It's not for me.]
		"Maybe one day you'll recognize your mistake."
	[Then sit your scrawny ass in it.]
		"..."
		"I knew I liked you."
39. Generic line for an enemy:
	"My tears couldn't wash away the guilt... but your blood might!"
40. Some NPCs should be weary of the Player, as they're basically undead. Others should be ecstatic, because you're a Legendary Hero reborn.
41. The player should wake up with coins on their eyes (as part of the ritual to revive them).
42. More conversations with wizards about their leader:
	Player: 	"Why did you follow a Mad Wizard?"
	Sorcerer: 	"Why? Because of all that he knew, and all that he would bestow. The secrets we unlocked in that tower put any incantation you know of to shame."
				"He might've been mad, but he gave us potential at worlds we could hardly imagine. I know the crown had its doubts, but he truly envisioned a utopia for us all."
	Player: 	"And no one kept him in check?"
	Sorcerer:	"His skill was unrivaled. And we dare not interrupt his process when the fruits he provided were so bountiful."
				"As his pupil, I once saw him birth a tree with his bare hands. Twisting the seed to sapling, to branches, and then back again into seed."
				"He understood things that you and I simply aren't meant to know."
	Player: 	"You seem to still be enamored, despite the obvious casualties."
	Sorcerer:	"The significance of such magick can only be realized when witnessed firsthand."
43. Discussions/Concepts for first encounter with the Hivemind Priestess
	Priestess: "Excuse me traveler, I'd like a word with you..."
	*Player approaches the Priestess*
	Priestess: "I've known of your arrival for some time now. About the undead horde, and your plans to stop it."
	Jester: "One of the bandits must have come here after fleeing us. They're trying to turn the Realm against us."
	Priestess: "You would be wrong. It was God who told me of your arrival."
	Jester: "Excuse me?"
	Priestess: "God speaks with me often and shares his wisdom. He takes many forms. Sometimes he'll take them all at once. The conversations can be... hard to follow. But his message is always clear."
	Jester:	"Let's get out of here. She sounds unwell."
	Player: [Prove it.] [I believe you.]
	Priestess: *smiles*
	Priestess: "I assure you I'm as lucid as you are. How else would I know her name to be Aylmera. Or that your companion, Alexandros is responsible for her revival."
	Priestess: "I was even told of your disagreements. How Alexandros dreams of a future free from the King, while the Jester remains loyal to the old guard."
	Alexandros: *Shocked exclamation mark* "How did she...?"
	Priestess: "And you, Aylmera. Where do you stand on all this? Who is fit to rule the Realm?"
	Player:
		[The King.]
		Priestess: "We'll see if that resolve holds strong for the remainder of your journey."
		[I don't know.]
		Priestess: "You certainly are of this realm. It's unease permeates even your ancient being."
	Priestess: "I understand that my methods are... unusual, but I must insist I join you from here forward. Not only is it the will of God, but..."
	Priestess: *Frowns sorrowfully*
	Priestess: "In the visions bestowed upon me, I've seen you die a thousand deaths. All 3 of you. Long before your journey is complete. The only outcomes where any of you survive are when I am alongside you."
	Priestess: "Take me with you, and see your journey to completion."
	Player:
		[Ok.]
		[If you insist.]
44. Conversation with soldiers from the War
	Soldier: "No King can rule ashes. Even our enemies recognize that."
	"The magic released from the explosion wasn't dormant, it immediately sought anything that could contain it, like fire seeking fuel. Living creatures became maniacal and possessed, while corpses rose from the dead. "
	"I personally slew dozens of my men before I was again safe inside our city's walls."
	Player: "You were present at the explosion?"
	Soldier: "Unfortunately. But I was fortunate enough to be outside the initial blast."
	"Not a soul remains that hasn't seen horror. You'd be wise to remember that."
45. General comment from Neera, the Hivemind cleric:
	"I had to lose an eye before the hidden truths revealed themselves to me. How much do you think you'll have to lose before YOU see clearly?"
46. A medical priestess who patches you up partway through the game:
	"Your body carries with it the scars of a thousand battles, and yet I've never seen flesh as youthful or resilient. I fear you, as I know I should. Do you fear for us?"
47. General note on the impact of the characters
	* Something that should quickly dawn on the player (and all other main characters) is that saving the Kingdom has little value while the Kingdom still lacks an heir.
		- As such, opporunities will arise where characters will begin to scheme for who and what will take over following the King's death (natural or otherwise).
48. A scene where the player falls into deep water and has a dream/hallucination while unconscious.
49. A scene (cut-away to a full portrait) of a pig laying down in the grass drinking a beer.
	- Based on Rufus from Twitter.
	- Just a cute illustration of a happy pig.
	- Maybe give the option to pet him, where he gives an "eager oink" as thanks.
50. "Only the dead can purge the sins of the living."
	- Does this really match what I'm trying to say overall? Does it even add up with the player's actions?
51. "Lotta blood flows in your wake. 'Course that makes it safer to travel after you..." - The Bard
52. Perhaps combine the Bard and Ol' Scratch into a hybrid character of sorts.
	- One who perfects their craft as they travel in your wake.
	- They comment on your actions, with a sinister flair.
	- They play a melancholy tune that makes it immediately evident when they're in the area.
	- They judge the player for their violent actions, in a teasing manner.
52. The Lord discussing his doubts about the King
	- "He tries to maintain control of the entire Realm. But at his age... I wonder if he even controls his own bowels."
	- "Following such a man can only bring disaster. Not just to my keep, but to all the peasantry it serves."
53. Early on, when getting gear from the King's armory, the soldiers there should express doubts about your skills.
	- Despite her fabled weapon being a Greatsword, the player doesn't know how to properly wield one.
	- This serves as a way for them to teach you the basics of combat. (Though make this sequence optional for replays)
		~ Could mention real facts about Greatswords. E.g. On the grip: The top hand pushes, while the bottom hand pulls
54. Have an option to kill the wounded as you leave the Lord's castle.
	- Just straight up the option to do warcrimes despite the medics pleading for you not to.
55. Have a scene of undead sailors rising from the waves on the beach coming to attack the player
56. Add in a zone (possibly the 4th stone location?) of the Royal catacombs
	- These were raided by the wizards prior to the Great Explosion
	- Due to its proximity to the Great Tower, and its abundance of bodies, it's rife with undead.
	- It has an awful omen to it. Even Alexandros doesn't wish to enter it.
57. As the game progresses the non-human enemies should become more grotesque (flesh golems, etc.)
	- Meanwhile the humans encountered become more beautiful and/or "civil" on the surface in how they behave.
		~ This is to underline how their actions are so grotesque and awful, but they are seeming unaffected by their own treachery.
58. Encountering the statue of Aylmera should trigger a cutaway to a full screen view of the statue along with a text description.
	- "Before you stands a statue of a woman adorned in decorative armor. It's comprised of intricately woven armored scales, and it drapes over her body beautifully."
	- "Her posture is that of an elegant fighter, with a face that is fierce yet soft. She is the most beautiful woman you have ever seen. And she looks nothing like you."
	- "The inscription reads: 'In memory of Aylmera, Martyr of Antiquity and Hero to the Realm.'"
		~ Perhaps this should be revealed somehow BEFORE seeing the statue, so that the final line can be "And she looks nothing like you."
	- The party splits to discuss the obvious discrepancy between you and "your" statue.
		~ Two main responses could be: [Flattered.] or [Confused.]/[Concerned.]
59. "I would kill you all if only to free myself."
60. Have a mage whose tongue can be cut out to spare his life, but prevent him from casting horrible incantations.
61. Instead of HP use "Morale".
62. Instead of player "Death" have party "Dishonor".
	- Perhaps even a defeat screen that says "Dishonored".
	- Also have a Fallout-esque failure screen that randomly selects a text dialogue to describe how you failed and what happened after.
63. Each of the main areas (dictated by having a unique Boss) should have an overall theme to the plot.
	- Castle = Ruin/Ruination
		~ Everything should have an aire of falling apart.
		~ Soldiers stretched thin. Nobles entirely unprepared for and unaware of the imminent danger that looms.
	- Forest = Opportunism
		~ They claim to want to uplift the peasantry, but have yet to do it. There seriousness of their pursuit can be questioned.
	- Lepers = Hope/Trickery
		~ Despite the hope of all these people, they ultiamtely want to indoctrinate you.
		~ They wish to manipulate you into abandoning your mission. (Which represents abandoning everyone else in favor of a selfish minority.)
		~ The irony is that they themselves have been abandoned by the whole (the Realm).
			~ The player should mention how the Crown "never mentioned anyone living all the way out here".
	- Mountain Caves = Judgement
		~ Despite the Bloodhound pursuing his own form of Justice, it is blind and unjust. It tries to Moralize a very Grey world.
	- Highlands = Oppression
		~ Consider having chain-gangs present in some form.
	- Swamp = Mystery/The Unknown
		~ This is also where the player begins to LEARN of their own mystery (their identity).
	- Aether Ruins = Chaos/Savagery
		~ Pure, unfiltered violence and aggression. A wasteland of raw violence and war.
	- Royal Catacombs = Peace
		~ Perhaps the only peaceful zone in the game.
		~ Only the dead may know peace.
		~ Even then, there is evidence of the Wizards' attempts to disrupt that by stealing corpses.
			~ Long abandoned undead should still work in the catacombs and nearby mines, etc. Extracting goods from the earth.
			~ Despite the fact that their masters long abandoned them (or died).
			~ The undead continue tirelessly as a reminder of the now broken empire the Wizards attempted to build. (And its great moral cost).
		~ Witnessing the undead still at work should offend the Jester (and perhaps the player) at Alexandros.
			~ "You observed all this happening and did nothing? This is consecrated earth, all these skeletons earned their peace."
	- Castle Finale = Ruination Realized
		~ The King is dead or hostaged. Most of the soldiers and nobles are slain.
		~ The castle itself is now damaged, unable to be defended properly.
		~ An usurper sits on the throne.
		~ Throughout the game, the player learns there isn't a single person deserving enough to rule the Realm.
			~ But at the end, they realize they've killed everyone CAPABLE of even ruling it.
			~ The only thing left is "To return it to dust and ash."
64. Design a Title Screen
	- "Ruins of Aether"
	- Stylize it after Medieval Manuscripts
	- Have the wreckage of the Great Tower shown in the distance.
	- Perhaps have an eagle-eyed view of the the map
		~ Castle, forest to the west, ruins to the east, Mountains to the North
	- Use color, black and white isn't enough.
65. For some key fights use a unique battle scene, one that's larger or has obstacles inside of it.
	~ Perhaps even use different ones for different world environments.
	~ This will change things up AND can be used to throw off the player to create a more pressing fight.
66. The Lord has weaponized the Church.
	- And in turn the Church has allowed itself to be weaponized.
	- The main religious leader (a cardinal-esque figure?) stands at odds to Neera.
		~ Neera to them: "God speaks ill of you. He even agrees with himself on that."
67. Change the color of enemies (their pallettes) to show they're vulnerable in combat.
	- E.g. a character could swap to a different color when exhausted, or when there's an opening in their pattern.
	- Otherwise, have them be invulnerable.
	- Explain this mechanic via the combat tutorial. (And make that whole thing brief.)
68. "Better to bend than to break."
69. "I have no quarrel with you."
70. Living through a time that is the calm before the storm. After having already lived through a brutal storm.


Misc Dialogue for encounters:
===============================
1.  Player: "I heard your enemies called you 'The Butcher'.
	Butcher: "No. My friends call me Butcher. My enemies know me by many other names: Killer. Cannibal. Rapist."
	Butcher: "I wonder which title you'll choose for me." *Smiles*
	* Engages the player, triggering a battle *
2.  Unknown: "Though many saw the explosion, most don't remember it well. Because of the sheer chaos that followed it. But I was here, watching intently from my post. Taking in every moment as it flashed before me."
	Unknown: "I saw the frenzy fill everything it could touch. Bodies of all shapes and sizes, dead or alive, human or animal, it didn't matter. They all rose together under the sole banner of unbound chaos."
	Unknown: "In truth... I envy them. They're the only ones at peace in the aftermath."
	Player: "Certainly you don't consider the present situation an improvement for the Realm?"
	Unknown: "Why shouldn't I? You and I are in no position to judge the will of nature, and no King has ever established such uniform peace. You know they never fight amongst themselves? They don't even feast on the dead. They simply hunt the living."
	Player: "So you wish to join them? Take part in their uniform peace?"
	Unknown: "No. I wish to observe them. Perhaps the truth of their world will reveal a path forward for us all."
	* You leave the man to his ravings. *
3.  Lord: "Have you ever felt certainty about your role in restoring so-called order to the Realm? What does that even mean to you? Is it about serving a single King, or serving the many inhabitants of the Realm?"
	Lord: "My father spent his life serving a King, your King, and his reward was swift death on a suicide mission. The fate of his men was the same, the few survivors were either maimed or traumatized."
	Lord: "I often wonder how much more he could've accomplished serving his people."
	Lord: *Pauses* "Do you think there's such a thing as a 'justified' war?"
	Player: 
		[Absolutely.]
		Lord: "You would have liked my father. He'd have led you to a glorious death."
		[Absolutely not.]
		Lord: "Then perhaps you are not as much a fool as your King." (referring to the Jester)
4.  (This occurs shortly after the player has slaughtered the Leper colony.)
	*Party passes a hermit sitting alone, in a tunnel by a campfire*
	Hermit: "You seem tired, please come sit by the fire and rest a moment."
	Player:
		[Accept.] (Rework this slightly, FORCE the player to Accept the invitation.)
			Hermit: "It's not oft that travelers venture this close to my seclusion. Truthfully, I miss their companionship."
			Alexandros: "Are you not here to be alone? To be isolated, with peace of mind?"
			Hermit: "...Yes, I am. Yet sometimes what we need isn't what we desire. Tell me, which guides you more, your needs or your wants?"
			Player:
			[My Needs.]
				Hermit: "Practical and admirable. To deny one's desires is a true strength."
			[My Wants.]
				Hermit: "Understandable. What are we if not creatures guided by our comforts?"
			Hermit: "So then, do you know what lies ahead for you?"
			[Yes.]
				Hermit: "And yet you still accompany me? I suppose it's easy to feel dead in such a lonely world. Perhaps I'm not the only one who desires compassion..."
			[No.]
				Hermit: *Smiles* "That's alright. I know well enough for the both of us."
			Hermit: "I want to tell you a story. When I was younger, I was known for my keen sense of smell. So much so, that I earned the nickname Bloodhound in my village."
			Hermit: "You see, I could pick up the stench of death on a traveler long before they reached our village. I protected us from lots of violence this way..."
			Hermit: "But one day, a young man approached. His body and eyes were tired, as though he'd been walking for days. And though, to me, he reeked, he was so timid and frail that no one thought him any threat."
			Hermit: "He told us his family had been slaughtered by bandits, their blood still staining his clothes, as he threw himself at our feet and begged for our assistance in seeking revenge."
			Hermit: "It must have been pity that led us to believe him, but we diligently formed a searchparty that followed him to his family's farmstead. It wasn't until we arrived that we were ambushed by his creations."
			Hermit: "He was an unholy magician, a necromancer, and the entire property had undead beneath its soil. As we searched the house, they rose from the earth and surrounded us."
			Hermit: "By some miracle, we were able to escape. But with our dead and injured, we were slow to return home. Our abscence from the village allowed his minions to easily overrun it. The bodies were all cold by the time we made it back."
			Hermit: "Truthfully, I've forgotten the faces of many of his victims. But that stench... that sickly, sweet aroma... It sticks with me in an unnatural way."
			Hermit: "But nevermind all that. Us old-timers have plenty of time to reminisce on our pasts."
			Hermit: "Thanks for keeping me company."
	*As the player goes to leave (back-turned), the Hermit throws a knife at them and lunges, triggering combat.*
	[If Accept., Needs., and Yes.]
		Hermit: "I'm sorry. But I can't let myself risk another mistake..."
	[Elif Accept.]
		Hermit: "I know you're not him, yet... you carry his stench."
5. Ranger: "You can't imagine the volume of death that I saw. That WE saw. We followed that fool and his son into a brutal war. And what was our prize? My arm still lies on that battlefield. Accompanied by the bones of my brethren."
   Ranger: "There's nothing you can say to change my mind. The King's wishes will only bring us further ruin. As long as you serve him, you must be stopped."
6. Jester: "I've known the King a long time... I consider him one of my closest friends. But after his son was born, I saw a glimpse of something better. A brighter future for us all. That boy grew into a man more capable and noble than even his father. His intuition was unrivaled, and his heart pure. Even the King could see it. And it filled him with immense pride. But the King's hubris led him astray."
Jester: "He couldn't be dissuaded from war with the wizards. And his son, eager to please his father, led the final charge. The one that exploded the Tower. I saw the destruction it wrought, not just on the surrounding lands, but on the King himself. He's tried to reassembled the crumbled pieces, but he lacks the skill to do it. If only the Prince were here in his place... The Aether robbed our Realm of a deserving King."
	- The Jester coming to terms with how the King is unfit to rule.


Combat System:
==============
Aug 22, 2022:
--------------
Ran into issues with the sprite being too large now and causing issues when placing it in the world.
	- Could be mitigated by having 2 different player sprites. One that's 16x16 for the main world. One that's larger (to include the sword) for inside the battle scene.

Now all that's necessary is to figure out how to get lots of projectiles on screen.
As well as what each of the characters' abilities are, and how they'll synergize with one another.
	- Can I implement attaching DoT affects to enemies? (Neera moveset)
		~ E.g. make it so attacks deal double damage for a period of time (or 'X' number of hits) after landing a blow with a particular character?
		~ What is her dodge mechanic?
	- Can I implement a LoZ style Roc's Feather jump for leaping over projectiles? (Aylmera moveset)
	- Can I implement a Dashing mechanic with associated "blurred" graphics added? (Jester moveset)
		~ Can I make the player immune to damage while mid-dash?
	- Can I implement firing projectiles from the player on a short cooldown? (Alexandros moveset)
		~ Instead of a sword, he'll fire out attacks.
		~ What is his dodge mechanic?

Overall, the goal is to have 8 unique mechanics for combat. 2 per character.
	~ One offensive (A button attack)
		a. Sword
		b. Throwing knives?
		c. Beam attack + debuff? (a straight-line attack that applies a debuff)
		d. Magic orb projectiles (3 shot out)
	~ One defensive (B button dodge/roll/jump/etc.)
		a. Aerial jump
		b. Dash
		c. HP heal on a decent cooldown (20s? Also heals only a bit?)
			~ Would need to avoid damage with NO dodge mechanic in order to spam heal as well.
		d. Temporary shield wall? (would need to be painted over the background)
	
Aug 2, 2022:
-------------
What if it was a top-down fighter style bullet hell, where you can attack, block, parry, etc. Against enemies and projectiles.
	- This would take place in a battle scenario, so it's not in the overworld.
However! The twist is that you only ever play as a single character at a time, but you can Swap between characters at will.
	- Allowing you to combo different moves and elements together.
	- This would be very Genshin Impact-esque, though adapted for top-down GBC combat.
	- It would also be reminiscent of Legend of Zelda boss fights. Though with more intrigue.
	- Whoever you're currently swapped in to is who takes damage.
		~ Maybe just bind Select to character swap. It could just cycle between them.
		~ Unless I could do button combos, then "Button + Left" vs "Button + Right" could cycle directions.
Having different characters have different ways to mitigate getting hit might be interesting (but too much difference would just be annoying)
	- E.g. One character JUMPS over projectiles
	- Another can just hold a BLOCK button
	- A third can PARRY attacks (or maybe ALL characters can parry)
	- The real limit here is going to be the amount of buttons you have, and how much interaction with projectiles you can add in.
If one character dies, it needs to immediately toggle to the next available character.
	- If no characters are left (who are alive) then send to a Game Over screen.
	- I'd love a graphic similar to Fallout and Fallout 2, where is shows the player's bones rotting away somewhere.
		~ Could attach to it a dialogue note about how they returned to the ashes and nothing they once were.
		~ Additionally, consider using RNG to pull a variety of quotes out whenever you die.


New:
-----
1. What if there are different damage types for enemies (a la space station 13)
	- And 100% of an enemy's HP type in ONE area must be depleted in order to kill them.
	- Enemies would have different HP levels
		~ E.g. Slimes would have LOTS of brute protection, but less burn and toxin protections
	- Enemies could be examined via abilities to learn of potential weaknesses.
		~ This information could even be explained via lore books found throughout the world.
	- A way to know ROUGHLY how much of a damage type you've done would be helpful
2. Still have traditional JRPG style battles, but now with different damage type attacks.
	- And each character could have specialties (e.g. Aylmera can deal the most direct Brute of anyone)
3. It would be cool to have these same damage types for the Player's party, but that UI would be difficult to implement, especially given limitations. Definitely sleep on it.


Old:
-----
1. Lanes of Combat
	- Each character can attack a lane (even empty ones).
	- Enemies move, or take up space in different lanes.
	- They also position themselves where certain lanes are defended, while others might not be. 
		~ E.g. Shield covering right-side, not the other.
	- Player has to adapt to enemy movements and defensive adjustments.
	- Player and enemy attacks can hit multiple lanes of combat.
	- Player can swap the order of their team around as well.
		~ Enemies tend to attack in front of themselves.
	- Combat options:
		a. Attack
			~ Branches into a typical physical hit vs a selection of skills.
		b. Move (Swap)
		c. Items
		d. Run

	Expanding the idea:
		What if there was no move option?
			- Just put skills in the 2nd slot directly.
		Could ignore MP altogether. Instead just have skills with tradeoffs.
			- Some skills fatigue you for your next attack.
			- Others lower your defense, or offense, etc.

	Can I combine the avatar into part of the healthbar sprite?
		- Have it be the first 16x16. (Hidden if the member hasn't joined)
			~ Hide the HP bar as well. (Just set the tiles to be all black).
		- Otherwise, the other 2 tiles serve as the HP bar.
			~ Visual only, it won't include a number at all, just a percentage reputation w/ descriptor.
			~ Could also have a color that changes as you get more beat up (Green/Yellow/Red).
	
	COULD assemble multiple different battle screens (with the avatars drawn on the background).
		- And just call the appropriate one.
		- Then you could attach HP and MP together.
			~ But honestly, MP kinda sucks. Not having it could be cool.

	Imagine if you had 2 frame animations that could flip the HP card over and reveal "DEAD" on the back.
	
	The center area can hold the actor whose action is currently being decided.
		- Maybe add the text above it saying 'Attacker' or something.
	
	-----------------
	Just design a simple Fight only system where you can select Enemy 1, 2, 3, or 4 to attack (depending on how many on-screen).
		- Also add in an EScape mechanic
