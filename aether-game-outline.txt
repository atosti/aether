Simple things to Work On:
==========================
18. Design a landscape scene with panning and parallax
	- Just do it as a proof of concept for now, then incorporate it into zone transitions later as the map is fleshed out.
19. Draw a cutaway scene for a roaring fireplace.
	- Also design the tile sprite for this fireplace.
21. Add a balcony to the War Room.
	- Have a ceiling the player passes under to walk outside.
		~ Feature a cutaway scene to a POV vista showing the city beyond the castle.
		~ Also needs a vista to be shown in the background of the surrounding landscape.
23. Design trinkets for the tables.
	- Battle maps, figurines, pots full of scrolls, potted plants.
	- Also design a Grandfather clock.
35. Come up with a name for the King.
	- Reginald? Octavian?
36. Design a neutral soldier sprite.
	- And assign it to the NPC in the War Room.
50. Design sideways facing chairs for the dining hall.
51. Add leaning portraits and rolled up scrolls to the Hidden Alcove.
	- Make it seem like a room cluttered with old junk.
54. Add notes describing an ancient revival ritual to a table in the Oubliette.
	- Obviously, this is to give backstory on how Aylmera is revived.
56. Design tiles for the kitchen
	- Cheese, barrels, kegs (on their sides), wine racks, cupboards, ladle, knives.
57. Design a pile of bones tile for misc catacomb floors.
	- Look at the LoZ botw fan art. Also look at oracle of ages/seasons for reference.
58. Figure out how to draw tiles in front of the player.
	- Do this for the pillars in the throne room.
	- Could make them sprites with no collision? Is that worth the resources?
61. Design a few different Battle scene backgrounds (behind the enemy actor tiles).
	- These can be used for a few different environments.
		~ E.g. In a Cavern vs. On a beach vs. In a forest vs. In a castle.
		~ Nothing too complex, just a general vibe. The sprite limits will be close on these screens.
62. Design NPC sprites for the nobles in the Royal Court
68. Design additional rooms in the castle.
	- Off the doorways in the halls and throne room.
70. Design a basic drawbridge texture for the player to cross as they leave the Castle.
72. Design a flower pot that can be placed on the table tiles.
74. Design Pews for the Chapel.
	- Also design an altar and candles.
75. Draw a Monk sprite.
	- 4 tiles is fine for now.
	- Just needs to be a basic with the skirted egg hair and the classic brown robes with the rope belt.
76. Begin drawing the Prince's undead form
	- He can likely be a special enemy with a 32x32 sprite.
	- Make him hulking and massive. I'd love for him to hold his weapon off to the side.
		~ A la Saturos. Or even Pyramid head in some ways. Dragging it beside him.
		~ It should seem a bit unwieldy and burdensome.
	- He should just be a hulking knight with big armor that he's bulging out of.
		~ Ideally it should be half-shattered armor pieces.
77. Draw an armor stand
78. Draw a weapon stand with spears and swords
82. As the player and their party approaches the Aether Ruins toward the end of the game, Alexandros accidentally lets slip that he's never been inside.
	- This causes the Jester to question what his "preparation for the realignment" (why he didn't immediately join you) really was.
	- If pressed, Alexandros reveals that he wasn't a high enough rank wizard to ever enter the basement unaccompanied.
		~ This is despite the fact that he was QUITE highly rank, AND is now the highest-ranking member left alive.
84. Oubliette sprites needed
	- Stacked books, from the floor
	- Piles of scrolls on tabletops
	- Candles/Candelabras
	- Grates to drain blood
	- Torture devices (stretching rack)
	- Wizard sprites
87. Figure out how to do scene transitions where the screen blacks out in different ways
	- E.g. when trainer battles would start in Pokemon Blue
88. Design the music that plays during the intro (pre-awakening)
	- Inspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEWCCSuHsuQ
	- Incorporate ominous vibes and have the instruments fade in/out
93. Create sprites to handle combat moves
	- Horizontal sword swing, stabbing, overhead swing, blocking, and a parrying effect.
99. Make a door sprite for a spiral staircase (a la Golden Sun)
	- Can give the illusion of moving vertically in space between maps
100. Create animated background tiles for lights in the castle.
	- Wall sconces
	- Wall torches
	- Tiki-torch style standalone torches	
	- Braziers
104. Design the inventory system.
	- For now it just needs to be a screen showing all key items
107. Continue writing randomized death messages to display on the Game Over screen.
	- Use the Fallout 1/2 death messages for inspiration.
		~ https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Death_messages
108. Draw an image of the player's dead body for the Game Over screen.
	- Again, reference the Fallout 1/2 death screens for reference.
		~ http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/0/02/Death.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20050330070537
111. Design a slight intro segment, where the player actually sees themselves wake up on the floor of the Oubliette.
	- Create animation frames of Aylmera lying on her back or the ground.
	- Add some dialogue, perhaps of the wizards chanting an incantation? ("Arise... Arise... Arise...")
117. Walking into a sprite and interacting will cause the player to be in a "moving" animation loop while the dialogue plays.
	- Is there an easy fix to this? It's not horrible, but it is a bit jarring.
122. Modify the engine to enable 8-directional movement in top-down 2D screens
126. Have some of the NPC interactions around the castle change when the Jester is in your party.
	- Let him walk out from the party and be a part of the scene.
	- Utilize his avatar to illustrate when he's speaking.
130. Add Alexandros to the conversation with the Jester + King.
	- Have both he and the Jester incensed that they aren't traveling as a 3-person party.
	- The King insists they split up. Everyone agrees to meet up at the Lord's castle to the North.
	- Set it so the Wizard walks up to you and the Jester talking with the King (from the South.)
		~ When engaging in dialogue with the King, have your character walk to a specific spot to facilitiate that all characters fit well in the scene.
	- Have Alexandros walk up (from the South) into the scene alongside the Jester and Aylmera (after some short dialogue prior.)
133. Draw portrait avatars for each of the main antagonists.
136. Add examine text to the book the man's reading in the West Hallway.
139. Write examine text for the shield hung behind the King.
	- Describe a family crest for the Crown, which can then be used at later points in the story as well.
	- Basically, create what the shield for their family should look like in the world. And write text to describe it.
140. Design an elemental weapons system and a way to infuse different elements into each party member's weapon.
	- Should different attacks color the enemy differently?
		~ E.g. Fire = Orange palette, Water = Blue palette
	- What types should there be?
		~ Types to match the main elements of the story, duh!
		a. Earth
		b. Water
		c. Fire
		d. Air
		e. Aether?
	- Order of Strength:
		Water > Fire > Earth > Air > Aether > Water
		~ Where ">" denotes superiority. So Water is strongest against Fire, etc etc.
142. Create a sound effect to trigger on battle engagement
	- Perhaps similar to the Golden Sun monster scream for their battles
	- Or just play an intro sequence of a song, then transition into the full song for the fight? A la pokemon.
143. Create a sound effect that sounds like the crunching of flesh and bone.
	- Can be played when killing NPCs in the overworld.
146. Update the attack animations to consistently use the same hand (left)
	- Note that as of now, Aylmera uses mainly her left hand for animations, but her RIGHT hand for facing Right.
147. Implement a working proof-of-concept for scene transitions that pixelate the entire screen in varying shapes similar to those in Pokemon.
148. Consider implementing the "Attach Script to B Button" for attacks conditionally, when changing the character (and on init)
	- This would allow different shapes/sizes for attack patterns. Depending on the active character.
150. Change the two men conversing in the East Hallway to use triggers instead of On Interact scripts
	- This may allow them to maintain their facing, instead of turning toward the player.
152. Redraw wooden crate sprite to be from a top-down angle (add a slight bit of the front to the sprite)
	- Think of how the Pillars are drawn, showing some of both the top AND front of the object.
153. Consider adding a somber violin piece as the soundtrack to the Swamp zone
154. Upon first encountering the Eastern Garrison, have the camera pan up to show the entire wall for a moment.
	- Then, play the dialogue encounter with the player.
155. Design a system for triggering combat scenarios with enemy groupings chosen at true random.
159. Draw a sprite of Aylmera bleeding from her eyes/nose/mouth.
	- Whichever of these comes through best.
	- Used for the passive decay that she experiences during the game.
160. Draw a sprite of Aylmera hunched over slightly.
	- Meant to show she's experiencing pain.
	- A pose of her fallen to her knees would be good, too. Could add some movement to the scenes.
	- Maybe have her clench at her chest with one hand?
161. Create a large number of screens (a bit of a challenging path) between the Garrison and the Aether Ruins Basement.
	- Reaching it should be an optional objective. The number of screens will help illustrate how far they've gone and the barren nature of the area.
	- It should also have tricky encounters. It doesn't have to be anything new, just lots of hard fights back to back.
165. Implement save locations rather than saving from the menu.
	- Just like saving at statues in Sword of Mana.
	- Just need to figure out what Aylmera should be using to save...
166. Use the Phantasm font for key events?
	- Decide how/when to use this. Perhaps for certain characters? Like those of the Void? Or the Spirit of Aylmera?
172. Design a way to black out the whole screen to visually cue engagements.
	- Could use Overlay layer, but that seems limited in how it can draw it.
	- Could immediately change scene? To one where the player and the enemy sprite are redrawn, then adjust the background?
	- Visualize exactly what you want it to look like during transition, then replicate that.
173. Consider changing Neera's avatar to be of a cross, or open bible/holy book.
175. Check that loading from a save plays music that was playing. Otherwise, add music to all the scenes in the castle.
176. Create a music track for the oubliette (and perhaps also the hidden alcove)
177. Change the laugh noise to just be a generic upbeat set of like 2 or 3 notes.
	- The current one is too long and out of place sounding.
179. Design an initial fight. Likely the Barracks tutorial.
	- Create some ways to test developing interesting fights.
		a. Lots of projectiles (10+)
		b. Multiple enemies (at least up to 3)
		c. Interesting collisions for maps (perhaps collisions that change mid-fight)
			~ Consider friendly abilities that can fire THROUGH collisions.
		d. Boss patterns that change once they reach certain health.
		e. Fake boss deaths (or rather the introduction of boss phases)
180. Design a generic soldier sprite that has a full range of movement.
	- Can take from Aylmera's armor, and just add a bald headed NPC.
		~ From there, minor tweaks of adding hair/a helmet can create different characters.
	- This is necessary for the soldiers around the castle and especially the commander in the Barracks.
181. Look into GBVM methods for increasing the volume or tempo of songs/music channels during combat
	- E.g. When landing a hit on an enemy, make the noise louder for a brief time.
	- This might not be possible/feasible, but I'd like to investigate it.
183. Design combat in a Mike Tyson's Punchout way
	- Large enemies that have attack patterns you need to learn to dodge/parry.
	- Player uses large swings with some lag attached to them (so timing is important)
	- Player is allowed to move around the stage more than MTP (but perhaps can only ever look up?)
187. Create the Quartermaster sprite + battle animations.
188. Implement the Quartermaster fight.
	- Introduce some basic mechanics.
		a. How to strike
		b. How to parry (maybe have him say this partway during the fight or something?)
		c. Have exaggerated, or very obvious patterns of attack that the player can adapt to.
		d. How to dodge (if implemented)
189. Design a combat transition that shows a close-up of Aylmera's eyes
	- It will just be a slit showing her face super close up, focused on her eyes opening.
	- Could also create one for each opponent that's fought, and have that played.
	- I imagine the animation being an empty screen with a horizontal strip that slides in left-to-right.
	- It shows her closed eyes, which once fully on the screen open up in a determined way.
	- Ideally, the opponent's eye slit would also slide onto the screen from right-to-left above Aylmera's eyes.
		~ And they would open their eyes in sync.
	Overview:
		a. Starts on overworld screen (default scene)
		b. Screen flashes to white twice quickly, before becoming full white.
		c. Black eye slits slide into frame for the characters. (eyes closed)
		d. The characters open their eyes at the same time.
			~ A sound cue is played as well, denoting the start of a fight.
		e. Full fade to white, then fade into the battle scene.
		f. Control is given back to the player and they fight their opponent.
	- ALTERNATELY:
		~ Design a transition screen that reads VERTICALLY and says "BATTLE" on half the screen with another half being a vertical full-body image of either Aylmera or the opponent.
		~ How many tiles can I draw using background tile swapping?
190. Create 2 sound effects for emotes (positive, and negative)
	- Maybe even more specific. Have a quizzical tone for '?', or confusion, etc.
192. Look up songs that capture the vibe of each bossfight you want
	- Can be a real song which is licensed or has vocals, just get the vibe then create your own track from there.
	- This will help in fleshing out each fighter, zone, and their themes.
198. Add a menu item for "Jokes"
	- Allows you to ask the Jester to tell you a joke. Pull from a series of real medieval jokes.
	- Bonus points if you implement a menu item that lets you converse with all of your party members throughout the story.
	= If implemented, add times where the jester is too distraught to provide you jokes.
199. Look into aligning dialogue and music so that characters can "sing" along to the musical tracks during parts of the narrative.
201. Add more memories screens to fill out the remaining Memory entries
	- Build it as X many screens, with a quick fade in time triggered when going left/right.
		~ Add a page flipping sound as well.
	- Add a sprite to the Memories page showing that Select will "flip" the pages to the right.
	- Potentially do Start = Page right -> and Select = Page left <-
205. Draw overworld/battle sprites for the main Antagonists
	a. Vivian
	b. The Apothecary
	c. His Lordship
	d. High Priest
	e. Prince Morcant
	f. Vivian II
	g. Foreign Paladin
206. Draw overworld/battle sprites for minor Antagonists
	a. Bandits
	b. Undead
	c. Lepers
	d. Skeletons
	e. Northern Soldiers
	f. Red Flower Soldier
	g. Spirit of Aylmera
	h. Monks/Nuns/Priests
207. Reorganize all of the misc dialogue into the chapters of the story they belong within
210. Create an emote for being horrified/terrified.
213. Adjust memories vertical movement to snap to location (rather than use default player movement)
214. Add light chanting from the Oubliette wizards of "Arise... arise... arise..." to the introduction exchange.
215. Rework the Quartermaster's dialogue to avoid locals and better encapsulate his personality.
216. Create a sprite for a statue of the Queen
	- Add one front-and-center to the Royal courtyard, so the player sees it when leaving the castle.
	- These will act as save points. Place it in the player's path to prevent them from missing it.
	- She should have a Saintly pose/aura.
		~ Perhaps look at Virgin Mary statues for reference
	- Consider designing other small altars/places where people have left offerings to the queen.
		~ Collections of flowers, fruits, trinkets, etc.
	- Maybe reference Lady Justice?
	- Probably 16x32 size?
		~ Ensure it stands out with more than just a different color.
		~ Want to avoid players confusing it for a living character.
	- Would love a series of multiple similar, yet unique statues of the Queen.
217. Create an emote for pondering
	- Perhaps a hand on chin + looking up?
	- Seems very difficult to convey.
218. Design more entries for books/volumes/histories/records, etc.
	- Need more written works to fill out the world.
219. Rework the examine text for the coffin in the Oubliette.
220. Add more nobles around the castle, especially around the Dining Table.
221. Select a new color scheme for all NPCs
	- A greyish blue might work well to match the mood
222. Add a large firepit/brazier to the center of the Great Hall
223. Rewrite the Memories entry for the Royal Quest
	- Referencing the Jester's dialogue about the Royal Quest.
	- Mention the 5 elemental stones and their elements.
	- Mention the restoration ritual.
	- Perhaps mention doubts about how the restoration ritual"*should* work"
	- ALSO: Decide whether to trigger this on the King's send off, or the Jester's dialogue.
		~ Probably still the King's send off, so you can mention the first destination/location of the Elemental stone. (Lost city to the Northwest)
224. Rework the King's dialogue on his send off to explicitly mention your first destination (The Lost City Catacombs)
225. Design a screen for the Drowning scene.
	- Have animated/moving bubbles slowly drifting to the top.
	- Give the scene the impression of being deep underwater
	- Perhaps have it be a scene of being underwater that then swaps to the Waking scene.
		~ Maybe have the bubbles be sprites in the scene with animation frames that cycle?
	- Alternately, have the underwater scene also BE the drowning scene
226. Add a Menu item for a map screen.
	- Doesn't need to be implemented yet, just add the screen and menu items.
227. Draw out the designs for the Map screen
228. Absolutely FILL the world with detail. All interactables and NPCs should have at least a paragraph or two of dialogue.
	- Add more generic NPCs who have lived experiences in the world and can elaborate on the history.
	- Incorporate their feelings/emotions. What do they feel? Why? What options are they undertaking to counter the chaos?
229. Think of areas where documents can be gathered for the player to read/examine.
	- Libraries in Keeps/Castles
	- Scrolls/letters sent and kept between main characters
		~ Add posts which still do, or used to house messenger birds.
		~ Have a large tree full of birds and all their abandoned messages at the bottom.
	- Notices posted at key crossroads to warn/guide locals/travelers
	- Book collections held by the wealthy or well-read
		~ Giovanni could have a villa with a well-stocked library
230. Add a music toggle variable (and menu option) that is checked prior to playing any music tracks.
231. Design the UI element for controlling player stances (Defensive/Offensive)
	- A square in the bottom-left corner which displays either a Shield or a Sword icon.
	- Come up with a clear/concise way to label it. Because "Stance" is likely too verbose to fit above it neatly.
232. Create a simple HP bar or system for the player
	- Either use hearts, or a dimishing lifebar, or something new?
	- Would love to add flavor to this to have it represent your Morale, or Fortitude, etc.
	- Also, aim to reduce the amount of screen space dedicated to this item.
233. Add large boss HP bars.
	- Dark Souls style at the top of the screen would be cool.
		~ But screen-length bars are too massive in terms of sprite count.
	- Consider how you want a player to recognize that damage is dealt.
		a. A noise is played when an enemy is hit.
		b. The enemy flashes all white for a brief moment? (With an outline, though.)
			~ This requires sprites for all of their stances to be drawn as outlines as well.
			~ Consider how the LoZ handled this by reversing color schemes.
			~ Maybe simply a sprite palette swap for a moment is better. It involves SIGNIFICANTLY less sprites.
		c. The HP bar should also flash, or have some sort of feedback.
			~ Modern bosses tend to have the tip of the remaining HP flash.
		d. How much should an HP bar chunk down at a time? Can I show all miniscule damage, or only once it's reached milestones (1/10th, 1/2, etc.)?
			~ If damage is ever received, the HP bar needs some sort of visual feedback (even if it doesn't visually move), such as flashing all white for a moment.
		e. Is there a way to NOT have an HP bar, but still communicate damage?
			~ Having an enemy get progressively more bloodied/beaten would be cool, but would AGAIN, require lots of duplicate sprites.
		f. Also, consider designing for multi-phased bosses.
			~ This will add a lot of depth to the fights as well as add a sense of progression.
234. Design/Draw sprites for the player's attack and guard types
	Attack Types
	-------------
	a. Quick swing/swipe, Left to right (Tap A)
	b. Slower overhead swing, Raise sword over right shoulder, then Right to Left swing downward (Forward + A)
	Guard Types
	-------------
	* This needs work, direction + B can't be roll, because then how would you approach while holding a guard? Unless guarding is just a quick parry or a dodge roll.
	a. Lift sword into a guard stance for a minimum amount of time, then can be held indefinitely. (Tap/Hold B)
		- If sword raised within a certain time from of an attack landing on the player, then they parry, and get invuln frames allowing them to move forward?
		- Otherwise, it blocks damage, but pushes the player AWAY from the direction of the attack (and their opponent).
	b. Dive roll in a direction, character locked into animation during/after (Direction + B?)
235. Create an emote for drunkenness
	- Maybe like Flushed cheeks?
	- A bottle?
	- Something that seems reminiscent of hiccups?
236. Create Vivian's first battle scene, the dialogue lead-up and the battle itself.
	- Vivian's theme: Signs of Trouble
	- Player arrives from the South to a makeshift throne with Vivian sitting atop it. As they stop, several bandits emerge from the bushes/sides and flank Aylmera + the Jester.
237. Create the basics of fluid souls-like movement (as close as you can) in GB studio. Just use placeholder images, it's fine.
	- Dodging, blocking, heavy attack, light attack, parrying?

* Understand that a lot of things will be placeholder for now. Come back to polishing later. Get the core ideas and screens built.

		Or having him never speak a certain vowel or consonant. Replace E's or A's with apostrophes, etc.
	- "Amidst the consecrated earth of the royal graveyard, we found a man."
	  "He was praying beside the Queen's grave, whispering softly to himself."
	  "He recognized me for my armor. Said we were kinfolk, though we'd never met."
	  "Defending the Queen's gravesite from desecration, he fought against us."
	  "Yet upon defeat, he threw his weapon aside and simply begged us to stop."
	  "Realizing his actions were in vain, he tearfully walked into the ruined wasteland."
	  "Should we have gone after him? Why was he here? Where did he go?"
X. Anguish (Witness the King's castle from a distance, as it's enveloped in flames.)
	- Write more. 
	- Witnessed the King's castle enveloped in flames.
	- The entire party should be shaken by this.
X. Pyrrhic Victory/Vivian (Fought Vivian a second time, this time killing her.)
	- Write more.
X. Desecration (Dig up the Queen's grave)
	- Write more. "Unearthed the queen's grave for her enchanted pendant".
X. Restoration (Performed the rebalancing ritual with the restored stone of Aether)
	- Write more.
	- "Do the undead still walk?"

* Adjust the ending SLIGHTLY. Return to the castle to retrieve the pendant.
	- Encounter Vivian here and kill her atop the throne.
	- Then go BACK to the Aether Ruins in order to perform the ritual and finish the plot.

Core Gameplay Loop:
====================
1. Exploring the world and learning lore via:
	- Dialogue with NPCs
	- Reading notes/books/engravings
	- Noting the history of areas and what events led to their current states
2. Encountering factions/antagonists and hearing their perspectives
	- Also discussing with your party the rationale behind your choices
3. Encountering smaller enemies and triggering fights
	- They patrol around the zone, catching their attention triggers combat?
	- Think a mix of pokemon trainers and enemy patrols? Or maybe Magi Nation style combat triggers?
	- Could also just have zones (like Tall grass in Pkmn) where encounters can randomly occur
4. Combat
	- Combat takes place in instanced arenas, customized to each zone of the map.
		~ Perhaps even unique to bossfights as well.
	- Each enemy will have bullet hell attacks, and patterns, which the player must combat via positioning and selecting when to strike.
	- Enemies will also have attack phases, allowing for openings where extra damage is dealt to them.
		~ Could use color or a certain glowing effect (e.g. Glowing spots in Elden Ring) to show vulnerability
	- If possible, showing enemy healthbars on-screen somewhere (even just always as a footer/header) 
		~ Could change it to show the last enemy hit.
	- Old ideas for playing as each character:
			- Can I implement attaching DoT affects to enemies? (Neera moveset)
				~ E.g. make it so attacks deal double damage for a period of time (or 'X' number of hits) after landing a blow with a particular character?
				~ What is her dodge mechanic?
			- Can I implement a LoZ style Roc's Feather jump for leaping over projectiles? (Aylmera moveset)
			- Can I implement a Dashing mechanic with associated "blurred" graphics added? (Jester moveset)
				~ Can I make the player immune to damage while mid-dash?
			- Can I implement firing projectiles from the player on a short cooldown? (Alexandros moveset)
				~ Instead of a sword, he'll fire out attacks.
				~ Or his attack could be ranged, but at a fixed distance in front of him, with a gap between him and his target where NO damage is dealt.
					~ Like placing a whirlwind a few tiles away.
					~ This would require very exact placement of the player when fighting.
				~ What is his dodge mechanic?
			- What about poison damage on a character with a shorter range weapon?
				~ e.g. Jester with a poisoned dagger
			- What about an AoE damage ability, that has a shortish range, but allows multi-hitting?
				~ Could force the player to hold still while using it, similar to the cross in Faith.
		Overall, the goal is to have 8 unique mechanics for combat. 2 per character.
			~ One offensive (A button attack)
				a. Sword
				b. Throwing knives?
				c. Beam attack + debuff? (a straight-line attack that applies a debuff)
				d. Magic orb projectiles (3 shot out)
			~ One defensive (B button dodge/roll/jump/etc.)
				a. Aerial jump
				b. Dash
				c. HP heal on a decent cooldown (20s? Also heals only a bit?)
					~ Would need to avoid damage with NO dodge mechanic in order to spam heal as well.
				d. Temporary shield wall? (would need to be painted over the background)
				e. A self-buff to deal more damage for a short amount of time? (Could affect all characters, even after swapping)
			~ Select -> Changes character
			~ OR Select + B cycles forward through the party, and Select + A cycles backwards.
				a. This would allow plain Select to also be used as a second ability for each of the characters.
					~ Need to experiment with hand placement on a Gameboy to make sure these feel natural enough when facing lots of projectiles.
		Regardless: The goal is to have 4 UNIQUE ways to fight, that all feel very different. They should also have elements that are complementary to encourage switching.

Main Antagonists:
=================
1. Abandoned Realm Ranger
	- An archer who was present at the siege of the Great Tower.
	- Having lost faith in the Kingdom's ability to rule the Realm, she now raids their supply lines. 
	- She Feels the Kingdom is undeserving of rule after it poisoned the landscape so wholly.
	- Was absolutely traumatized by her unit fleeing and, then having to slay undead versions of her allies to survive.
	- Controls a tiny band of raiders who seek to usurp and overthrow the King.
	- Lost one of her arms since the Great Explosion.

	- A grassroots leader who rallied disenfranchised soldiers and bandits under one banner.
	- Harasses the local population for supplies to support his otherwise noble goals. Believes it's a justifiable cost for a better future.
2. One-armed warrior?
	- Acquires a second arm made of magic?
	- Could have multiple battles. First time is against them with one arm, second time is once they've acquired a second.
3. Undead Prince (Morcant)
	- Filled with Aetherial rage. Uses a massive 2 handed sword and wears bulky armor.
4. Apothecary
	- Sickly and weak, but very astute and philosophical. Acknowledges the need for change in the Realm's leadership.
	- Accelerationist. Perhaps sees no future for themselves, and by extension wants the same for the rest of the Realm.
5. The Player
	- Over the course of the story, the player learns that they are indeed NOT the fabled hero whose stories are littered across the region.
	- The Wizards mistakenly resurrected you, a cousin of that hero (a simple mixup in the many bones of the catacombs).
	- As such, the player learns they were a rebel warlord that broke from the Kingdom and...?
	- The Player is not forced to be evil as a result of this, but IS directly playing as someone who once was cruel and bitter.
	- These details are revealed overtime as more lore is learned:
		a. Hero has a birth mark or tattoo that the protagonist doesn't share.
		b. Player has no memory of any of their heroics.
		c. Player should have an anti-affinity to something that the Hero was known for.
			~ e.g. Hero was always known to be physically warm, thought to have fire inside them. Meanwhile, the Player character gets cold in various regions and is freezing at once point.
		d. When given the Hero's fabled sword, it should feel slightly too heavy for you.
6. Vampire Lord
	* Consider repurposing this character into a torturer in His Lordship's expansive dungeon.
		~ He doesn't need to be a vampire. Could just be a real weirdo who's cultish.
	- Man who is losing control of his flock of followers. Has little interest in assisting the realm, as the undead mostly leave him alone, and he's a recluse after all.
	- The party could be forced to enter his manor as a means to escape a growing undead horde they've attracted.
		~ Then they must navigate the inside and escape.
	- He's inhospitable, though not opening hostile initially.
		~ Has no interesting in feeding on the party, but wouldn't mind them simply being dead (less long-term enemies that way).
	- "I know your ilk, Slayer. You're blessed to have your kills deemed righteous by the Crown. But if you were exiled... how many would still perish?"
	- Although very old, he should still (technically) be younger than Aylmera. He makes remarks about this, and how unusual it is.

Character Names/Titles:
=============================
Core theme: "Being forced into Nihilism."
	- Everything should tie into this.
		~ Trying to push yourself to do good, or do ANYTHING substantial, and being forced to face how little it matters.
		~ Learning to evaluate what DOES matter. Reflecting on what will persist despite your efforts.


* Denotes personality traits to assist with writing dialogue.
	- Note: Almost everyone should have at least a tinge of defeatedness to them. This is a BROKEN world that just finished a brutal war.

1. Aylmera, Esteemed Warrior
	- Protector of Antiquity
	* Stoic, a bit of a blank slate for the player to project themselves
	* Dutiful, headstrong, skeptical
2. Sigmund, Court Jester
	[Core Fault: Cowardice]
	- Famous jesters seemed to have nicknames (e.g. Gaska, meaning Goose)
	- Possible names: Toad? Hugo? Drake?
	* Outgoing, Enthusiastic, jovial. A literal jokester.
	* Wears his motley attire which has also been reinforced with armor plates and hardened bits of leather.

4. Neera, Hivemind Cleric (Diviner?)
	[Core Fault: Overly duty-bound/self-righteous]

		- Further investigation reveals she communicates with a hivemind of entities which counsel her.
		- Although her condition could be attributed to something more akin to Schizophrenia, it does allow her pre-cognition of key events.

5. ???, King of the Realm
	- Reginald (too dweeby)?
	- The Crown, His Majesty
	* Prideful, bull-headed, tired, impatient, emotionally cold, dying (at the end of his life and he knows it).
	* A decrepit old man at the end of his life. He managed to survive the Sorcerers' assassination attempt during the war.
		- But his son and most of his Royal Guards were slain during the siege of the Great Tower. 
		- This was an outcome the King did not desire, as the Prince was his only heir. He understands that he's too old to lead much longer. Without a proper heir and the tension of pending war, he fears he might be the last of his royal line.
		- Ultimately, he blames himself for failing to manage his kingdom and failing to protect his heir.
6. Morcant, Prince of the Realm
	[Core Fault: Blind Loyalty]
	- Defender of the Realm
	- Alternative name for him: Marshall?

	- He's seen as responsible for destroying the Great Tower.
	- He's viewed as an aggressor by much of the Realm and especially by royalty.

	- "Kneel when you speak to her." - One of her loyal followers.
13. ???, Bard, Minstrel (Edwyn?)
	* Note: He's not meant to be a 'Moralizing Mike' character that shows up at the end and relays to the player all the 'bad' things they've done.
	* He's meant to point out the futility of saving a world that the player themselves is actively destroying. And his disatisfaction with having to live in the remains.
	* He's meant to humanize the world a bit. To add someone that responds to the sheer violence of the world around them.
	- Jovial, but judgemental of the player.
	- Over the course of the game, he encounters the player several times and slowly comes to realize the destruction they're causing.
	- Often sings in rhyme about the player and his opinion of them.
		~ In many ways, he's supposed to act as a record-keeper of sorts. An oral historian (presumably, if he's to live into the future).
	- Very amicable. Other characters (misc npcs) regard him and his music highly. He brings Joy to a Joyless world.
14. ???, Squire
	- Presently an unused character, but a Squire could be an interesting component.
15. ???, Lost Paladin
	[Core Fault: Stuck in the Past]
	- Battered Paladin, Broken Bruiser, Old Dog
	* Paladins were scarce before the war (as holy magic was outdated vs. geomancy), but especially now since many of them died in the war with the sorcerers.
		- Interestingly, many paladins operated as sell-swords, akin to Samurai in Japan. Thus, they fought on both sides of the war.	
		- Once revered as beacons of morality and the will of God, they're now seen as idealogues who threw away their traditional ideals for false hopes.

Order of Main Events:
======================
Music to write to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIX1lWOUaGQ&list=PLw1SQn79wR4Z4an1CBWQPi_UNDdgNDDNU&index=4

1-A. The player is revived in the oubliette and told they're the great warrior Aylmera. Unbeknownst to them, this is not their identity.
	- She wakes up (make animations for this). Alexandros is there and explains a bit of how she got there.
	- He is mostly concerned with himself, and not the player.
		~ He prides himself on being able to revive her to the glory of her youth.
	- Alexandros mentions offhand that it was an experimental ritual.
		~ Though disappointed you don't have your memories, he is unconcerned.
	- Urges the player to bring any questions they have to the King, who is upstairs.
1-B. Aylmera meets with the King upstairs.
	- He warmly greets her. And describes his need of a "legendary hero" for an important quest.
		~ Says its important to the stability of the entire Realm.
		~ Note that he is one of the few non-party characters who accurately sees the significance of the Aether.
		~ Have him EXPLICITLY mention Alexandros by name, and that he was the one who revived the player.
			~ This will help prevent confusion if the player decides not to speak with Alexandros immediately after waking.
	- Prying in just the right way can reveal a moment of humility from him, where he admits he wished he didn't have to revive her.
		~ Poking through his bedroom and notes reveals bits of internal doubt.
		~ It points to a man who understands he's at the end of his life. He's out of time and options. His bloodline cannot continue, but his kingdom MIGHT be able to.
	- He tells Aylmera to find the Jester in the castle and return to him for the details of her pending journey.
2-A. Searching the castle, Aylmera finds the Jester in the War Room.
	- He greets her warmly as well, but is cynical of the King's plan.
	- Returning to the King, Aylmera and the Jester are told of their mission to recover the elemental stones.
	- He describes the plan as follows (leaving out many key details the player learns later):
		a. There exist 5 elemental stones which control the balance of elemental energies in the Realm.
		b. Things in the Realm were fine until recently, following conflict in the far East, one of these stones was shattered, upsetting the balance.
			~ (He doesn't elaborate as to why this happened. Or in what capacity.)
		c. You are to find the 4 remaining stones, take them to a ritual site in the East, and shatter them to release (and restore balance) to the elements.
		d. He knows of 2 leads for the locations of these stones:
			~ The first was hidden by his soldiers several decades ago in a now-ruined city's catacombs (to the far Northwest).
				~ It was specifically hidden alongside the remains of one of his ancestors. It should still be there now.
			~ The second is in possession of an allied Kingdom to the North.
		e. He has just sent Alexandros, alone, to fetch the one in the North and expects Aylmera and the Jester to get the one from the Catacombs of Antiquity.
			~ The Northern region is ruled by a Lord loyal to the Realm. The King is confident in the Lord's cooperation.
		f. Once you have fetched the first stone, you are to rendezvous with Alexandros and continue locating the other stones.
	- This is much different from the plan the Jester thought they were doing.
		~ The Jester is taken aback, he didn't know he was going to personally carry out the mission.
		~ Moreover, he thought that Alexandros would be accompanying Aylmera, not going on such a dangerous journey alone.
		~ Despite his disagreements and protests, the King insists on this plan, souring things for them both.
			~ It should seem apparent that they're not being fully honest with you. But neither volunteer more information.
	- The Jester slyly criticizes the King's wishes before heading off.
		~ The King and the Jester have a close relationship, but are often critical of one another. (Think of two old best friends or rivals.)
	- The King also notes that they should get geared at the Armory before leaving (an optional task).
2-B. (Optional) Aylmera visits the Armory/Barracks for some initial gear.
	- Inside, a Commander greets her coldly, but outfits her with the best sword he can (a meager one).
	- It's a greatsword, her staple weapon, and she has no idea how to wield it. He stops her from swining it so as to not hurt herself.
	- "What the hell are you doing? Haven't you swung a greatsword before?"
	- He points out that (as in real life) When gripping a greatsword: The top hand pushes, while the bottom hand pulls.
		~ Could tie this into a simple tutorial for the player about how to use their skills.
		~ Regardless, make this quick and painless for the player, don't drone on and on about controls.
3. Aylmera and the Jester leave the castle and enter into the surrounding city's ruins. It's full of scared peasantry.
	- Soldiers are spread thin and acknowledge they can't protect much more than the castle itself. Much of the city is left to its own devices.
	- Inside the castle, nobility is only concerned with the prior war (anti-mage sentiment) and the minor inconveniences of their lives.
		~ Chiefly, they complain about food and wine rations.
		~ And they feel all safety measures about the castle are overreactions by the soldiers.
		~ This is because many of the soldiers (at least those in command) saw the Aether frenzy, whereas the nobles have not.
	- Commoners are fearful of the roving banditry and wish the castle would open its gates to them.
		~ There are also whispers of undead creatures stalking in the night, but there isn't much concrete evidence.
			~ Aylmera can ask the Jester about these roving undead.
			~ The peasantry believes it to be divine punishment for the King's pride. And the sacrifice of his son.
		~ People who insult the King often face verbal backlash from the Jester. Despite their differences, the two are good friends.
4. Begin heading West through the surrounding farmland, sticking to the main road, while being mindful of the bandits.
	- Begin hearing rumors about the banditry planning something big.
	- There are rumors of revolution.
	- There is a feeling of despair, and a lack of options.
5. Find many farmsteads in disrepair or abandonment. The farmers who remain are powerless to protect themselves.
	- Some live day-to-day and hope neither the undead nor the bandits kill them.
		~ "I fear the undead most of all. At least a bandit can be negotiated with."
		~ "My great great grandfather built this farmstead. It's been in our family for generations. Don't see any reason why that should change now. Bandits are nothing new."
	- Others have given up, spending their days drinking as they feel the end is near, so what's the point any more?
	- The pubs are full, but hardly jovial. They have a more depressed aire to them.
6. Aylmera and crew make their way through the farmland outskirts and into the Forest. This is bandit territory and they fight their way deep inside.
	- Forced to take this route, as other pathways (e.g. bridges) have been sabotaged by the bandits. Or are raised pre-emptively by towns across the waters.
		~ Perhaps a bridge is kept raised by people on the other side of the river for fear of the bandits.
		~ As such, when the bandits are defeated, this bridge can be lowered (for faster travel to older zones).
		~ And this allows, narratively, other characters to more easily move around the world (e.g. the Bard and his circus).
	- Encounter some traveling merchants and minstrels (circus) stuck on the way. Perhaps a bard that's recurring periodically through the plot.
	- Some of the bandits can be conversed with, to reveal that they (at least claim) to want to support the peasantry.
		~ They oppose the Crown and seek a regime change, but steal from the peasants for resources.
		~ Though they claim to wish to uplift everyone when in power, they have yet to do any of it. No praxis, eh?
7. At the heart of the forest (in a clearing) is the bandit camp. A circle of caravan wagons. It's here they encounter the bandit leader.
	- She wears a hood and has long, shoulder length hair. Notably, she has only one arm. Her right arm. Vivian, the one-armed ranger.
	- Vivian is a former ranger of the Realm who was present at the Great Explosion. She wishes to overthrow the king and is using the elemental stone as leverage.
	- Before engaging the party in battle, she just has a large poncho over herself, only after conversing does she throw it off into the air, revealing her singular arm and crossbow.
		Vivian: "It's rare for anyone to enter our camp uninvited."
			"With the trouble you've been causing, I was certain there'd be more than just the pair of you."
			"Here to slaughter more of my comrades? Or are you perhaps here to challenge *me*?"
		*Vivian sneers.*
		Aylmera: "Neither."
		"All we seek is passage through these woods."
		"There's no need for further violence."
		Vivian: "Oh really? I wonder what my slain brethren would think of that proposition."
		Aylmera: "We're here on behalf of the Realm. It's vital we continue North."
		Vivian: "Hmph. And which members of the Realm would it be it that you serve?"
			"The ones in the fields working themselves to death?"
			"Or the ones who sit idly in a castle, sealing themselves away from reality?"
		*Jester interjects (perhaps steps forward one square)*
		Jester: "The Realm includes us all. Even the peasants your 'comrades' like to raid."
		*Vivian is unimpressed (bored).*
		Vivian: "Oh please. As if the Crown doesn't pillage these lands for his own benefit."
		"The only difference is he does it with the blessing of the law."
		"Unlike him, our actions have the blessing of morality. A war against the oppressor."
		"Our actions will lead to a better life for *all* in the Realm."
		"You'd have to be Aether-maddened not to see that."
		*Vivian pauses (...)*
		Vivian: "You know, Jester, I must admit: You intrigue me."
		*Jester questions this (?)*
		Vivian: "One of my scouts said they served with you the night of The Explosion."
			"That you're the same as many of us."
			"Witnessed firsthand the chaos, misery, and death of that painful night."
			"Yet you still kneel at the feet of that wretched King."
			"Even for a fool, that's pretty dumb."
		*Vivian laughs*
		*Jester is enraged*
		Jester: "As if anyone could have predicted the outcome of that war!"
			"His Grace still serves the Realm as best he can."
			"Meanwhile you sit here idly, poaching our men and waging war with the peasantry!"
		*Aylmera is confused (?)*
		Aylmera: "Jester, what the hell is this?"
			"You know these people? What explosion is she talking about?"
		*Vivian is confused and pissed (?!)*
		Vivia: "Are you nobles that out of touch?!"
			"THE explosion! The one that marked the end of the Great War!"
			"The one that sent shockwaves out for miles!"
		~ Aylmera is visibly confused ('...')
		*Vivian is enraged*
		Vivian: "Pfft. It's like you don't even remember it."
			"You nobles are all the same! Stewing in ignorance while the rest of us die under your misguidance!"
			"You might not give a damn about that night, but *I'll* never forget it: I'm not allowed to!"
		*Vivian throws her poncho open, revealing her lack of an arm.*
		Vivian: "Look upon my arm! I was the best ranger in the land, reduced to a cripple in an instant!"
			"And for what? Some noble's ego?!"
			"But what I-"
			"What *WE* lost in that explosion, we gained tenfold through kinship and comradery."
			"We stayed for DAYS in that hell, combing through it for survivors while fending off the damned."
		*Vivian pauses(...)*
		Vivian: "Yet when we returned home, we found the Crown had closed his gates to us..."
			"And that's when we knew where we stood."
			"Your King sits atop a throne, but it rests on foundation of blood and ash."
			"Even Morcant couldn't rectify such a thing!"
	- Vivian suddenly fires the first shot (a crossbow bolt) that collides with the player sprite, triggering the battle scene.
		~ Would be SICK if the scene quickly transitions into battle where the player must immediately dodge left or right to avoid the same arrow that was fired in the overworld.
	- Vivian should use a crossbow (one-handed) during her fight.
		~ She should also summon bandits to assist her in some way during the fight.
		~ What if she shot projectiles that bounced off the back/side walls.
8-A. Aylmera defeats Vivian, but Vivian is able to escape in a smokescreen (from a smokebomb) before she is defeated.
	- Due to her quick getaway, Vivian drops the first of the elemental stones (Fire).
		Jester: *cough cough* "Shit. She disappeared into the woods..."
		Aylmera: "She dropped something."
		*Aylmera walks forward and crouches down briefly*
		*Elemental Stone of Fire acquired.*
		Aylmera: "Is this-?"
		*Jester (?!)*
		Jester: "One of the stones! What was she doing with that?"
			"At least it's in our hands now."
		~ Notes in her tent/campsite reveal she had plans to 
	- Most of the bandits clear out, through fear. Maybe a few on the outskirts are left? Bitter toward you, but non-violent.
	- The stray bandits can mention how they heard stories of Aylmera's heroism. But that they don't see any of that now. It must've been lies.
8-B. The player is given a chance to ask the Jester about what Vivian mentioned. (Notably, he leaves OUT any details of himself having seen the undead and knowing they're real.)
	- "You wanna fill me in on what she was talking about?" - Aylmera
	- "No. There's not much to say." - the Jester
	- "I sincerely doubt that." - Aylmera
	- "The King decided it best to not smother you in details. It's important you recognize the importance of your, OUR mission." - the Jester
	- "You're still keeping me in the dark." - Aylmera
	- The jester frowns reluctantly.
	- "Alright. I suppose the Crown isn't here to protest anyhow. Where to even begin..." - the Jester thinks for a moment. ('...' emote)
		~ Have the Jester pace off from Aylmera during this, narrating his account of the war so far.
	- "Before your revival, conflict broke out in the Kingdom. A civil war about autonomy and leadership. On one side was the Crown with his royal armies. And on the other was the bulk of the royal wizardry, led by a... Mad Wizard."
	- 1. [Wizards? Like Alexandros?] or 2. [Mad Wizard? You mean he was insane?] - Aylmera
		1. "Yes, Alexandros himself even fought against us during the final months of the conflict. Though that was some years ago. Things were much different then. More volatile." - the Jester
			~ "For what it's worth, he's received a royal pardon now. And you'd be wise to remember that without him, you'd only be a pile of bones." - the Jester
		2. "Oh absolutely. Most wizards even agree on that point. I can't speak to his charisma, but their loyalties were sincere. A handful still believe in his cause." - the Jester
	- "Well, by the looks of things I'm guessing the Crown emerged victorious." - Aylmera
	- "Hahaha! Hardly a victory. Thousands dead, his armies destroyed and his throne... heirless." the Jester laughs to himself before getting quiet.
	- "Look, I'm a fool. I've made a life out of seeing humor where there is often only sadness. But make no mistake: That war brought us NOTHING but ruination." - the Jester trails off. ('...' emote?)
	- "And the 'explosion' that Vivian mentioned? You witnessed it?" - Aylmera
	- "Yes. I was at the forward base camp when it happened. Just outside the blast. I distinctly remember the swirl of blue flames erupting from the Tower, illuminating the night." - the Jester
	- "And then just as suddenly, it all came crashing down. A hail of stone and suffocating ash. Everyone inside was killed almost instantly. As were many outside." - the Jester
9. Aylmera and the Jester continue out the other side of the forest toward the ruins of a nearby city. Where they know the Crown hid one of the stones.
10. The typical path is blocked by debris from a landslide. As such, they're forced to go through a lesser-traveled tunnel.
	- Inside, a hermitish Nomad is encountered at their fire. They can be talked with to reveal some of their story.
	- He reveals that in his youth he could smell the "presence of death, the mark of a killer" on travelers.
	- He used it to save his village as a child, and was revered for this skill. A skill which he is (presumed) to no longer possess as an old man.
	- He bids them well as they part ways with him.
11. Aylmera and the Jester make it through the tunnel and arrive at the ruined city. To their surprise, there's a small colony of people living in its outskirts: Lepers.
	- Asking around for directions and info, the locals reveal that they knew of Aylmera's arrival. A visiting Priestess told them so.
	- Ultimately, they want nothing to do with the Crown or the Realm. They've been abandoned and have problems of their own.
	- They do have a de-facto leader who they admire for his empathy and strong will.
		~ They mention how he's an Apothecary who makes potions to ease their burden and pain.
12. Within the encampment, they find Neera (the priestess)
	- She informs Aylmera and crew of their Divine journey and her need to accompany them.
	- The Jester doubts her ability to commune with God (after she explains the hivemind that speaks to her in many, varied tongues).
	- She proves her connection to the Divine by mentioning that she knows of Alexandros' mission to reach the Lord.
		~ Moreover, she reveals that he will soon be in danger. She convinces them to let her join, as she's vital to their success.
		~ "I've seen visions of your journey a thousand different ways. Only when I'm alongside you do you even make it to the end."
13. Aylmera and crew venture further into the heart of the ruined city (in search of the catacombs entrance). Instead, they find the Apothecary.
	- Aylmera and crew meet him and he attempts to stress the importance of empathy.
		~ They don't really have time for his ramblings/teachings. And largely ignore him.
	- He seems like a Salesman, a con artist.
	- When they mention their purpose, he says he's been to the catacombs himself.
		~ Gets defensive, says he's seen nothing worth taking inside and advises they leave it be.
14. Aylmera and crew eventually make their way through the remnants of the city and into its old catacombs.
	- At the entrance is a statue to Aylmera, recognizing her commitment to protecting 'antiquity' from when she defended similar catacombs from necromancer pillaging during her lifetime.
	- The entire party acknowledges that it looks nothing like the player character. They shrug it off as some sort of error by historians.
15. Fighting through the catacombs, they defeat a large monster and then search the tombs where the King specified. However they find nothing.
	- They decide to search the Leper encampment for any clue of its whereabouts.
		~ They also suspect foul play from the Apothecary since he said he'd been inside before.
16. At the outskirts of the Leper encampment (toward the catacombs), Aylmera and crew are again approached by the Apothecary.
	- He reveals that he took the elemental stone a while ago, and gave it to the lepers for safekeeping. 
	- He urges the group to stop assisting the Crown.
	- "I thought the creatures below would be enough of a deterrent. Can't you see your success will only spell ruin for the rest of us?"
	- "Look at how that 'leader' treats his people. This city was forgotten and its people cursed. He's unfit to rule."
17. The Apothecary blocks their path and forces them to fight him in order to proceed.
18. Returning to the Leper encampment, Aylmera and crew are surrounded by the townsfolk.
	- They seem to know that the Apothecary is dead, since he isn't alongside your party.
	- "He warned us it would come to this. That you might not listen to reason. We swore to him we'd stop you if he couldn't."
	- They are weak and easily defeated, but must be killed enmasse to proceed.
	- The Priestess notes how her God thanks them for easing the suffering of the Lepers (through death).
		~ This creeps out the Jester who still has qualms about killing so many sickly people.
	- Only the shopkeeper remains alive (as he decides not to fight).
		~ "They died. And for what? Ideals which will be buried alongside them... Show me your gold."
19. Aylmera and crew proceed along the mountaintops toward the North-eastern city belonging to the Lord and his army.
	- They once again encounter the hermit along the way.
	- Yet again he invites them to chat beside him at his campfire.
	- He reveals that despite his gift, he was unable to save his village. A killer infiltrated them under the guise of a victim, and wiped most of them out.
		~ He blames himself for ignoring the stench of death that was so potent. Because he believed so wholly in the young man's innocent appearance.
	- Apologizes for troubling Aylmera and crew, then goes silent.
20. Aylmera and crew get up to leave, but as they walk away the Hermit rises and throws a dagger in their direction.
	- "I'm sorry. But I can't let myself make that mistake again. Your scent... it's identical. When you approached, all the memories rushed to me so VIVIDLY!
		~ He charges them and engages in a battle.
		~ Music Inspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeANouMyfnQ (the way this begins)
21. Upon defeating the Hermit, he exclaims, "I didn't last... but your foul odor will..." before collapsing and dying.
	- The Jester is again disturbed by this encounter. 
	- The Priestess doesn't seem to mind.
	- Worrying that things are getting more and more out of hand, the Jester urges you to meet up with Alexandros ASAP.
22. Continuing through the mountaintops, Aylmera and crew eventually arrive at a valley in the highlands and reach the outskirts of the Lord's lands.
23. They make their way through the farmland toward the Lord's castle/keep.
	- Due to its distance from the Aether Ruins, things here are more peaceful. Farmers go about their days, and soldiers periodically roam the outskirts actually patrolling the entire area.
	- The crew is not immediately recognized as serving the Crown, and are instead briefly interrogated at the castle's wall about who they are and why they're there.
24. Aylmera and crew accidentally reveal too much about who they are (serving the Crown alongside the mages) and are met with battle.
	- Can be done in a few ways, either mentioning that Aylmera was necromanced, saying Alexandros' name, or intentionally revealing they're with the Crown.
		~ Note that up to this point the King said the Lord was on his side. Whereas Neera hinted that Alexandros is in danger.
25. One of the guards runs away, screaming for help. The crew's cover is blown.
	- While most of the guards fight, one of them runs off (either before or after the encounter).
26. Aylmera and crew must fight their way through waves of soldiers as they cut a path to the throne room of the Lord.
	- "A thousand gold for whoever puts that bitch's head on a spike!"
27. Arriving in the Throne Room, the crew finds Alexandros bound and beaten, alongside the Lord himself.
28. Now aware of who they are, the Lord taunts them.
	- "Well now, the Crown sent you rats to do his dirty work. You must prefer his Chaos to my Order."
	- "I've already spent plenty of time with your friend here." *smiles* "Wasn't much of a conversationalist at first. These magicians boast of their strength, but many are so fragile."
	- He discusses with the player how the Crown can only lead them to further ruin, as he did in the war.
		~ Moreover, he displays his disgust for Alexandros and all mages like him. He views necromancers and their sympathizers as having revoked their humanity.
	- "The Great Hero Aylmera... What wretched misery they've subjugated your flesh. If you weren't an undead abomination, I'd pity you. Your existence is nothing short of sin itself."
29. The Lord reveals he has one of the stones, but refuses to give it to the party as long as they serve the Crown.
	- The Lord kicks Alexandros' shackled body down the stairs of his throne, toward Aylmera and crew.
	- Aylmera and crew catch his rolling body and unbind his hands/mouth.
		~ Aylmera: "Are you alright?"
		  Alexandros: "... *eyes closed* ..."
		  Priestess: "He's covered in cuts and bruises..."
		  Alexandros: "... Help me... Help me..." "Kill. That. BASTARD!!!"
		~ Music Inspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6cnKWFaAOM (Just the introduction, the high notes)
	- Alexandros immediately jumps up, charging up the stairs toward the Lord, beginning an engagement.
		~ The engagement starts with Alexandros immediately getting a free hit onto the Lord.
		~ Immediately after his hit, have a prompt stating: "Alexandros looks beyond furious. His palms are enveloped in white-hot flames."
		~ If possible, have his anger translate into some Double damage or something for the engagement.
		~ Alexandros also starts the fight at half health.
30. Once the Lord is killed, Aylmera and crew pick up his stone (the 3rd stone). And begin walking out of the castle.
	- The few remaining soldiers they encounter back away and run.
	- Even the townsfolk fear them. Some plead for their lives, despite not being in any danger.
	- Most lie bloodied and beaten, huddled in piles as they attempt triage.
31. Leaving the city, Aylmera and crew follow the nearby river downhill (descending the mountain) toward the East.
	- Along the way, they encounter one of the Lord's soldiers contemplating a stretch of the riverbank with thousands of flowers on either side.
	- He tells them how he remembers the War with the wizards.
		~ How he lost many friends at this very spot.
		~ How the river ran red with the blood of so many soldiers.
	- He laments that it was all in vain. That in the end, leaders only wish to rule, even if its over ashes.
		~ He notes that these beautiful flowers aren't ruled by anyone, and they're the most precious thing of all.
		~ He refuses to fight Aylmera and crew.
	- "How far down this path must you travel, before you know where it leads?"
		~ Alternately: "How far must you go down that path, before you see where it leads?"
	- "If you don't see it now, then certainly you must be blind."
	- (Optional) Perhaps he ambiently wishes/prays for death, but if engaged in combat he fights to the bitter end.
		~ This is because he's still holding on to something. You aren't meant to know what.
32. Aylmera and crew cross through a foggy marshland, where much of the land has, recently, sunk into the earth.
	- As such, the undead are thinner here than elsewhere. The area feels eerie and devoid of life.
33. They encounter a witch's hut deep in the heart of the swamp. She invites them inside and is hospitable.
	- Player progression is blocked by something (perhaps she has an animal in the way outside her hut?) until speaking with her.
	- Through discussions she reveals that she knows the player is undead. She then offers a spiritual reading.
	- She drugs the protagonist without their knowledge (lacing their food/drink), and uses their dazed state to extract information.
	- Ultimately, what she reveals is that the player does not have hero's blood. 
		~ That they have a dark history. That they carry the weight of many ruthless kills from their previous life.
33a. Part of what's revealed is that Aylmera's purpose guides her to the shores, just North of the swamp.
	- It's here that inside of a cave the Water Elemental stone resides. 
		~ It's unguarded, but set atop an altar here and seems to hold special religious value to those who used to live in the area.
	- This cave is adjacent to an abandoned fishing village which the party must traverse.
	- The shoreline is filled with dead fish. They've washed ashore and are rotting in the open.
	- Perhaps this is where the final encounter (and fight) with the Bloodhound should occur.
	- Ultimately, the party acquires the 4th Elemental stone and moves onward.
34. Aylmera and crew arrive at the Ramparts leading to the Aether Ruins
	- It's a patchwork of booby-traps. It's dangerous and full of numerous traps, which effectively act as landmines.
	- After the Wizards blew a hole in it, and the Realm lacked enough soldiers to defend it in its entirety, both sides booby-trapped it and its surrounding areas.
	- As such, it's long been regarded as a no-man's land. One perk is it prevents the undead horde from easily spilling through the hole.
35. Finding their way through, they arrive at the Ruins of Aether and make their way to the wreckage of the Tower.
	- Lots of powerful soldiers (now dead and/or possessed by aether) wander around as hostile husks.
	- A mixture of both undead wizards and undead realm soldiers are encountered here.
36. At the base of the Tower Ruins, they encounter the Undead Prince. An aether-husked corpse wandering aimlessly.
	- Note: Hardly a single floor of the Tower remains. It has almost been completely leveled.
	- The Jester immediately recognizes him and is horrified. His memories of the explosion rush back to him all at once.
	- The Jester is frozen by both shock and fear. He simulatenously wants to call out to the Prince, but also knows to fear him for the monster he has become.
		~ Perhaps the other party members are trying to run, and encourage the others to do so, but the Jester's shock forces them to stay and fight. (as Morcant closes the distance)
	- The Prince notices the party and approaches. He's slightly more lucid than other undead. Muttering to himself as he engages the party.
		~ Jester: *Frozen in terror*
		~ Alexandros + Neera: *Stance up for combat*
		~ Aylmera: *Turns around to look at Neera and Alexandros on either side of her.
		~ Aylmera: "What... is that? We need to move... Sigmund?"
		~ Morcant: "...Sigmund."
		~ Jester: *Shocked* "My... prince...! What has befallen you... Such treachery..."
		~ Morcant: "...Treachery..."
		~ Aylmera: *steps forward to be closer to the Jester (but he's still closest to Morcant, frozen)*
		~ Alexandros: "Aylmera. Back. Up."
		~ Morcant: "Cowardice..."
		~ Jester: "Morcant... listen to me. We're here to-"
		~ Morcant: *Lurches forward into the Jester, triggering combat.*
			~ If possible, have him lurch on all fours at the party, like an animal.

	- The Prince could mutter the Jester's name, Sigmund, (most people only refer to him by his title, "Jester")
		~ This would take the Jester off guard, as he realizes the creature recognizes him.
37. After a brutal fight, the party slays the Prince.
	- The Jester is distraught, he breaks down into tears. The player and party console him.
		~ Note: The Jester views Morcant as both a solid friend, but also as something closer to family. Close to a sibling, given their similarity in age.
		~		He is inconsolable immediately after the fight. And becomes manic as he rushes to figure out what to do with the Prince's body.
		Jester: *Kneeling, Crying* "*sob* I'm so sorry. Forgive me for my cowardice."
		Jester: "I shouldn't have left you. I thought you were dead..."
		Jester: "Oh how you suffered in my absence... My foolishness... I'm so sorry."
		Jester: "I'm so, so sorry..."
		Party: *Looks at one another for a moment*
		Alexandros: *Walks up, places a hand on Sigmund's shoulder* ""
		Jester: *Tearfully, still crying* "Please! Dig his grave with me. We can't leave him to the carrion!"
		Alexandros: "Sigmund... we can't just..."
		Aylmera: "We simply don't have the time. Besides, it's not safe here. There will be more undead."
		Jester: *Angry, gritted teeth* "Damn you to hell! I'll dig it by myself!"
		Jester: *Begins manically (quickly) digging at the earth beside the corpse with his bare hands.*
		Alexandros: "Sigmund. Knock it off, man! Stop! You don't even have a shovel..."
		Jester: *Stops digging, and just collapses onto his knees again (finally calming down a bit)*
		Jester: "It's not right. It's just not right... After all he did for the Realm... Besides, I... left him three years ago. I *can't* do it again today."
		Neera: *Warmly* "Though we can't preserve his body, perhaps we can still preserve his soul. I could say a funeral prayer in his honor, if you'll allow me."
		~ Note: Last rites are typically only read immediately before death. So this is unusual to read them after death.
		~ 		Also, remember that people say "God can't hear you out East", implying that this will likely go unheard by the Divine.
		Jester: "Yes. Yes! Please! Allow him a chance at atonement..." (this is ultimately what the Jester wants for himself in this moment, atonement)
		Neera: *Walks in front of the body of Morcant and recites the following* 
				"God, your power brings us from birth to death, your providence gives us purpose, and by your command, we return to dust." 
				"Lord, those who die still live in your presence, their lives change but do not end. I pray in hope for all those aether-stricken, and for all the dead known to you alone."
				"Let them suffer not in the afterlife as they have in their devotion to the Realm."
				"Bestow upon them your infinite wisdom such that they may find eternal peace. Amen."
		Jester: "..."
		Jester: "Does your God have anything to say about the Prince?"
		Neera: "...No."
		Neera: "He remains silent on the matter."
		Jester: *hopes dashed, sadly frowning* "..."
	- The Priestess offers to say a few words, his last rites, as they stand before his hulking corpse.
		~ "You fought valiantly, both in life and undeath. May your soul return to the peace of the great beyond. Just as your bones will return to dust."
		~ "Rest well knowing your duty to serve the Realm has been fulfilled."
38. Collecting themselves for a moment, the party readies to enter the basement ruins of the Tower.
	- Inside is a maze of magical traps, old and new.
	- Examining the design of the rooms and the symbols carved into the walls, they determine their goal:
		~ They must replace each of the 4 stones into its appropriate elemental slot.
		~ Something like one in each cardinal direction, or 3 in cardinal directions and the last at the center of them all.
	- The whole time, the party feels that something is off. As though they're being watched. As though a spirit is present.
	- There is also, notably, an ancient skeleton dead in the main chamber. The only one. (the real Aylmera's body)
		~ Might be a bit TOO much detail. Does it even make sense that no one has been here for like a thousand years to clean up her body?
39. Once all the stones are placed, they must go into the main chamber and perform a ritual that Alexandros has studied prior.
	- As they begin the rebalancing ritual, they are disrupted by a spirit. The spirit of the real Aylmera.
	- She shouts at them, as a banshee would screech, halting their progress.
		~ She states who she is, and demands to know what they are trying to accomplish.
	- Upon hearing the name 'Aylmera' the whole party (protagonist included) are astounded.
		~ They tell Aylmera (the spirit) that their party leader is the reincarnation of her.
		~ "You bear neither my soul nor my flesh, and yet you use my name. Who are you?" (the player does not know)
		~ "Strange. You reek of death and yet have an air of nobility." - Spirit of Aylmera
		~ "You wear my armor and wield my sword, yet you are not me." "Do you wish to mock me?" - Spirit of Aylmera
	- Alexandros realizes he must have retrieved the incorrect corpse from the royal catacombs. But is perplexed, because the body they took was buried alongside her unique armor.
		~ The tomb even bore her name.
		~ "This was the body labeled 'The hero of antiquity', the one who died protecting the catacombs from raiders."
	- The spirit of Aylmera reveals that she didn't die as the "hero of antiquity" like people thought.
		~ She was cornered in the royal catacombs by a rival army (seeking to pillage the catacombs).
		~ Finding herself cornered inside, she slayed some soldiers, swapped into their armor and then fled through their lines.
		~ Realizing (or knowing) that the goals of that army were to destabilize the natural balance of elements, Aylmera decided to travel undercover to the Tower's Basement.
		~ Stealth being so key to her success, and time not being on her side, she neglected to inform the Kingdom of her plans.
	- She succeeded in her mission, making it to the basement, but was sealed inside when she triggered a trap.
		~ As such, her soul (and corpse) have remained trapped inside.
	- As such, the player Aylmera is simply a nameless soldier. Revived without any memories of who they once were.
		~ But they've proven themselves, and the real Aylmera is impressed by their commitment to save the Realm.
		~ "If you truly wish to save the Realm, allow me to guide you."
40. Ultimately, the spirit of Aylmera warns them that the ritual they're attempting will shatter ALL of the stones, unleashing even more chaotic energies into the land.
	- Alexandros realizes the evil nature of the ritual.
		~ He also notes that his notes on the matter came from the Mad Wizard, who had begun training the mages in it.
		~ He wonders whether the Mad Wizard knew of its destructive nature all along.
	- The party is ultimately urged by the Spirit of Aylmera to abandon the ritual, recognizing that the stones must be left alone and protected in the Tower basement.
	- Instead, she guides them on how to restore the Aether crystal.
		~ "Warrior, I know not your name and it seems neither do you. But you've earned the title, 'Hero of Antiquity'. Bear it proudly. You carry yourself with great distinction." - the Spirit of Aylmera
		~ Aylmera should bless the party, and use her magic to heal some of the player's wounds, prolonging (for a bit) their eventual demise.
		~ The player's body should be something of a wreck at this point. So this allows them a chance to finish their task. Aylmera's mercy.
	- I want the player to feel proud of their accomplishments, but utterly lost. They now have no name. They have no past. Only a shrinking future.
41. The Spirit is disappointed to find that the Aether crystal has been shattered.
	- She realizes that the party must undergo a final leg of their quest in order to repair it and restore order to the Realm.
	- "You. Cannot. Fail. Too much lies at stake. And far too many have died for you to perish at the last step."
	- "You will need the power of a sacred pendant to finish the ritual. It was a relic entrusted to royalty in my lifetime. Someone you know must have it."
	- "I'm afraid that's as much as I can offer. I know not where you can find its caretaker."
42. The party leaves the Basement Ruins and talks amongst themselves above-ground about possible leads.
	a. The Queen's holy grave (located directly East of the Ruins of Aether?).
		- The party must go this way to reach the graveyard (a dead end) then return the way they came toward the Ruins of Aether.
		- The Jester is embarrassed, and ashamed. He IMMEDIATELY knows where the pendant is, but is grief-stricken by the desecration that must occur to recover it.
42b. What if...
	- Instead of being inside the Aether Ruins, the party must go BACK to the castle now in order to rob the queen's grave.
	- This forces combat with Vivian in a more meaningful way, and has the party finishing their journey within the ruins.
	- Moreover, it means they can have a false hope of "finishing this for the King" only to realize the undead still roam after the rebalancing is complete.
43. Reaching the Queen's grave, they find a strange man praying at the gravesite.
	- He wears armor similar to that of Aylmera.
	- He seems totally in his thoughts, not hearing the party as they approach.
	- Upon noticing them, he's polite, but also taken aback.
	* Note: The core of this character is that although he has lost everything (similar to all other characters), he has also lost his PURPOSE.
	* 		Most of the other characters at least have some driving force, goal, or ideology. He has nothing. He clings to a past that no longer exists or makes sense.
		~ He recognizes the player's armor as that worn by Paladins.
		~ Suspiciously, he asks who the player and their party are. Not drawing his weapon, but placing his hands on it defensively.
		~ Lost Paladin: "You bear the armor of a Paladin... Just who are you?"
		~ Player: "I don't know. I have no name..."
		~ Lost Paladin: "What? What are you saying? You there, Jester! Is this some kind of trick? Shame on you for pulling such antics in a graveyard!"
		~ Jester: "No, sir. There's no trickery here. She speaks the truth, it's just that she's..." *he trails off*
		~ Neera: "The last of her kind."
		~ Alexandros: "As much antiquity as she is its protector."
		~ Lost Paladin: *Bursts out laughing* "You're as right as you are wrong. She certainly looks a dying breed, but she is not alone."
		~ Lost Paladin: "You may not know your name, stranger, but your armor tells me we are kin. Paladins in arms. The last of our lineage."
		~ Neera: "I didn't know any holy warriors still remained. All the monasteries I know of are long abandoned."
		~ Lost Paladin: "Yes. I was my master's last disciple. And his youngest... With whom did you train?"
		~ Player: "I have no master. I am but a corpse. Given purpose for a chance at redemption."
		~ Lost Paladin: *Looking over at the party* *light frown/scowl* *whispered* "Stranger, which of them put you up to this?" (I like that this can be read as him still thinking it's a prank OR him believing it, and knowing they each have coerced her to some degree.)
		~ Player: "You misunderstand me. Though they each guide my hand, none are capable of creating the chains to which I am bound."
		~ Lost Paladin: "What you speak is truth?"
		~ Player: "Indeed. My master is of many faces. And they all control my soul."
		~ Lost Paladin: "Friend, I pray you get it back." (This is notably one of the few moments of empathy from a non-party, non-Aylmera character in the whole story.)
		~ Neera: "Forgive me, Paladin. But I must know: Why are you here? At her majesty's grave."
		~ Lost Paladin: "Well. Amidst all this chaos, I sought clarity. Sometimes old friends can enlighten us. " (He's here praying to the Queen, seeking guidance.)
		~ Lost Paladin: "And you all? Why are you here?"
		~ *The party looks visibly uncomfortable, as they look to one another to respond.*
		~ Aylmera: *pauses*
		~ Lost Paladin: "Come now. There's no need for secrets between us."
		~ Aylmera: *sighs* "We have come for her Majesty's grave. We must take from it. I'm so sorry."
		~ Lost Paladin: "*Take* from it? From her? What gives you the right?! Are you trying to provoke me?!"
		*Triggers an engagement*
		*After the battle*
		~ Lost Paladin: "Wait. WAIT! I yield!"
		~ Lost Paladin: "It's just... please. I... why? Why must you do this?! She deserves so much better, please!"
		~ Lost Paladin: "Don't defile her legacy, she's all I have left... What good is a world without sanctity?!"
		~ Lost Paladin: *crying*
		~ Party: *looks back and forth at each other, guiltily*
		[Trust us.]
		[I'm sorry.]
		~ Lost Paladin: "Damn your words, witch! They mean nothing when I can see your actions."
		~ Lost Paladin: *Walks away out of the scene*
		~ Alexandros: "We should get what we need and get out."
		~ Jester: "Agreed. There's no point lingering here."
44. The party returns to the Spirit of Aylmera and conducts the ritual.
	- Spirit of Aylmera warns the player that this might kill them both. As the alignment should kill any remaining undead.
	- However, it doesn't. Everyone is surprised. They discuss the implications of this:
		~ Basically, new undead aren't being created. But the pre-existing undead still shamble the landscape.
	- The Spirit of Aylmera thanks them regardless, and says she must stay to protect the balance of the elements.
	- The party leaves.


XX. Figure out what that final step is. Where they need to go, and how they need to return to the Aether Ruins.
	- How about having to fuse it with the bones of a pure, innocent person.
	- Basically, they have to dig up the Queen and defile her corpse in order to restore the stone.
	- *Everyone disliked that*. The party should HATE that they have to do this.
XX. After rebalancing the elements, the party leaves the Aether ruins and begins the final trek back to the castle.
	- They acknowledge the foolishness of the King.
		~ His inability to prevent the Bandit scourge.
		~ His inability to protect any of his lands or peasantry.
		~ His inability to protect any of the stones.
		~ His inability to see the danger posed to Alexandros by the Lord.
		~ His willingness to use dark magic (reviving Aylmera)
		~ His willingness to shatter more of the stones, without understanding them.
		~ His eagerness to wage war against the wizards, leading to the release of Aether and the death of his heir.
		~ His unwillingness to lead, instead sitting in the safety of his castle.
	- The team agrees to dethrone him (killing only if necessary) for the betterment of the Realm.
	- On the journey back, also make it clear that the Aether-frenzied creatures are now dormant. Returned to corpses.
XX. Making their way to the city ruins, they're surprised to find no one guarding the perimeter.
	- The theme of eerie stillness should return and be omnipresent during this stage of the game.
	- Returning to the castle courtyard, they find it in ruins. Soldiers and nobles lie dead.
		~ Consider forcing them to walk a different route to the throne room, in many ways retracing the steps of the introduction.
		~ As opposed to walking straight in to the Throne room, go through side passages and wind your way to the Great Hall.
	- All along the way to the throne, there is death and chaos. Furniture moved and smashed, smoldering rooms, etc.
	- Perhaps they have to walk through a blown up hole in the wall, instead of the typical entrance.
XX. Reaching the throne room, the player sees the King's crumpled body lying at the foot of his throne.
	- The Bandit Queen (Vivian) now sits atop it, with a handful of bandits at her side.
		~ The Jester approaches the King's body and closes its eyes. Showing the King mercy and respect.
	- Vivian: "You're too late. You couldn't save him."
	- Aylmera: "Had no intention of it."
	- Vivian: "Ah. Then you're more of a sellsword than I'd pegged you for."
XX. Misc notes on the Finale
	- I think I prefer an ending where the player further disrupts the balance of power, killing anyone left who could possibly rule, and then abandoning it completely.
		~ Leaving it to rot, or perhaps rebuild, or anything. But that they're finished. The effort by Aylmera and her team should be grueling and tiresome.
XX. Still need a way to get the 4th elemental stone (which isn't Aether)
	- Perhaps the King has been safeguarding it himself, and personally hands it to you upon beginning your journey?
XX. Aylmera and crew arrive at the Queen's grave.
	- What is significant here? Perhaps she died in childbirth. Her gravestone could read: "She sacrificed all she had for the continuation of the Realm. May her soul rest easy knowing we'll protect her dream, just as she protected ours."
XX. How did the King come to power?
	- Did he ascend the Throne by blood, or did he steal it from someone else? This could add more depth to his character.
XX. The player can kill the King.
	- *Smiles* "My kingdom died well before you dealt the deathknell..." "If I might have... one request... protect the Realm..." - The King's dying words
XX. (Alternate) Killing the King.
	- The entire party (especially the Jester) attempt to convince the King to step down. To allow a more competent ruler to take his place.
	- The King's ignorance and bull-headed nature prevents him from seeing reason, and so the player must kill him.
		~ He's a feeble old man, who dies easily. Pitifully, even. The player should feel bad about this, despite it being the correct call to make.
XX. Player enters a mansion that is overrun by undead (or they're barricaded outside at the door)
	- Must race against time to get reprieve from them.
	- Perhaps after slaying the armies of the Lord, the undead flood in to the now weakened zone.
XX. At some point, the Leper Leader should be revealed to be largely a con artist and huckster.
	- Although he does believe in providing them peace-of-mind, he's 100% aware that his medicines are placebo.
	- He also uses them to accumulate wealth and luxuries for himself.

=========================
Dialogue for Locations:
=========================
Max line length is 39 characters.

1. Royal Castle
	a. Conversations with wizards about their leader:
		Player: "Why did you follow the Mad Wizard's leadership?"
		Wizard: "Why? Because of all that he knew, and all that he would bestow!"
			"The secrets we unlocked in that tower put any incantation you know of to shame."
			"He might've been mad, but he gave us potential at worlds we could hardly imagine."
			"I know the Crown had his doubts, but Ignacio truly envisioned a utopia for us all."
		Player: "Even so, no one kept him in check?"
		Wizard: "His skill was unrivaled. And we dared not interrupt his process when the fruits he provided were so plentiful."
		Player: "You seem to still be enamored by him, despite the obvious casualties."
		Wizard: "The significance of such magicks can only be realized when witnessed firsthand."
	b. Conversation with soldiers from the War
		Aylmera: "Why aren't you at war with the Royal Wizardy any more?"
			"Don't you resent them for what they did to your Kingdom?"
		Soldier: "No one can rule ashes. Even the wizards recognize that."
			"You see, the magic released from the explosion wasn't dormant."
			"It immediately sought out anything that would contain it. Much like fire seeking fuel."
			"Living creatures became maniacal and possessed, while corpses rose from the dead, just as frenzied."
			"I personally slew dozens of my own men before I was safe again inside our castle's walls."
		Aylmera: "You were present at the explosion?"
		Soldier: "Unfortunately. But I was fortunate enough to be outside the initial blast."
			"Not a soul remains from that battle who hasn't witnessed the very definition of horror."
			"You'd be wise to remember that."
	c. The player should wake up with coins on their eyes 
		- As part of the ritual to revive them.
	d. Noble dialogue
		"Were it not for the undead threat, we'd likely still be at war with the wizards."
		"It's an uncomfortable truth we now face. And one that no one is soon to forget."
	e. The Jester and the King should have a goofy dynamic.
		- "This is my funny little emotional support guy."
		- Perhaps reveal this at a later point? Via documents or stories from others/Sigmund himself?
2. Farmlands
	a. A drunk farmer's self-reflection
		* Aylmera/Jester approach a happy, drunken man in the Farmlands' pub.
		- Aylmera: "You seem rather jovial. What's the occasion?"
		- Farmer: "The occasion? I suppose I'm celebrating the end of times."
		- Farmer: *Smiles softly*
		- Jester: "That's something worth celebrating?"
		- Farmer: "Why the hell wouldn't it be? I'm living to see it!"
		- Farmer: "You expect me to pick up a sword and change things? I've no interest in fighting another man's war."
		- Aylmera: "Aren't you at least worried about tending to your fields?"
		- Farmer: "Pfft. You nobles drown yourselves in wine and delicacies for decades without issue."
		- Farmer: "Draining US of everything we've ever worked for."
		- Farmer: "But the moment a farmer takes a day to himself, indulging in life's... finer things..."
		- Farmer: "Then, suddenly it's the business of the Crown!"
		- Farmer: *Mockingly* "Suddenly, the nobles become experts on the specifics of agriculture!"
		- Farmer: *Pauses (...)*
		- Farmer: "You really wanna know what my fields are like?"
		[Yes.]
			- Farmer: "The best of this year's harvest was wilted and shriveling long before ever being ripe."
			- Farmer: "I left the rest to rot on the vine."
		[No.]
			- Farmer: "Well aren't you an asshole. At least you're honest about it."
		- Farmer: "All anyone's got left is what we wisely fermented some winters ago..."
		- Farmer: *The man raises his glass in your direction.* "So, cheers! To the longevity of the Realm, and its dishonorable King!"
		- Farmer: *Laughs*
		- Aylmera: "Whatever you say, friend."
		(Upon talking again after) *You decide not to bother him further. There's no point in disrupting his joy.*
3. Village
	a. "For some, hope is the only form of survival."
	b. A scene (cut-away to a full portrait) of a pig laying down in the grass drinking a beer.
		- Based on Rufus from Twitter.
		- Just a cute illustration of a happy pig.
		- Maybe give the option to pet him, where he gives an "eager oink" as thanks.
4. Forest
	a. "The `Great War`? Nothing great about it. Just a lot of pain. And even more bodies we had to bury. "
		"Didn't even get a chance to celebrate our meager victory."
	b. Bandit: "You don't know of hardship. We had to pick over our comrade's bones for scraps and rations."
		- Bandit: "Were it not for Vivian's guidance, most of us would've been lost in the ruins."
		- Aylmera: "So you went from robbing the dead to robbing the living?"
		- Bandit: "Pfft. You can't steal from those who hoard. You can only redistribute."
		- Jester: "Do you think the vulture also rationalizes his actions to himself?"
		- Bandit is angered.
		- Bandit: "Bite your tongue, Jester! I know firsthand of your betrayal."
5. Bandit Camp
6. Caves
7. Lost City
	a. "The workers yearned to build, but found no materials to do so. So they wandered."
8. Lost Catacombs
9. River colony/Riverlands
	a. "There's been more lightning lately. It's starting fires at unprecedented rates."
		"Never heard of something so severe. Not even in my Grandfather's day."
	b. Villager responding to why people obey the strictness of Velazquez's rule.
		"People become resistant to predation when they feel safe."
		"Of course, the opposite is also true."
			- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8St36RjHd2E @ 38:39
	c. Villagers discussing the "civility" and "order" provided by Velazquez
		"It is oft civility which betrays our deepest hostilities. " "Don't you agree?"
			- Misc line. It means that when someone is civil is when they're typically being the most hostile and aggressive.
10. Western Lordship's Lands
11. Lordship's Keep
	a. "Never engage in a fair fight."
	b. Have an option to kill the wounded as you leave the Lord's castle.
		- Just straight up the option to do warcrimes despite the medics pleading for you not to.
	c. The Lord discussing his doubts about the King
		"He tries to maintain control of the entire Realm. But at his age..."
		"I wonder if he even controls his own bowels."
		"Following such a man can only bring disaster."
		"Not just to my keep, but to all the peasantry it serves."
12. The Dungeon
13. Eastern Lordship's Lands
	a. Maddened Enemy: "My tears couldn't wash away the guilt... but your blood might!"
	b. Rivers running red with blood during a battle, which left behind a now beautiful stretch of flowers on either side of the bank.
	c. Could have Giovanni (the artist) live in the outskirts here.
14. Monastery

		Neera: "I had to lose an eye before the hidden truths revealed themselves to me."
			"How much do you think you'll have to lose before YOU can see clearly?"
15. Boglands
16. Coastal village
17. Eastern wasteland
	a. "When killing everyone, does it even make sense to spare anyone?"
	b. Bard: "Easy, pal. It was only a question. Forget I even brought it up."
	c. Have a mage whose tongue can be cut out to spare his life, but prevent him from casting horrible incantations.
		Jester: "Well, his mouth is gagged, shall we just leave him here?"
		Alexandros: "What happens when he gets free? He'll raise the dead and hunt us."
		Alexandros: "We have to kill him to stop it."
		Neera: "You could cut his tongue."
		* Jester and Alexandros both turn and are alarmed (?!) *
		Jester: "Huh? Why the hell would we do that?!"
		Neera: "Cut off his tongue and he can't cast spells. Do it, and he gets to live."
		Alexandros: "Neera... That's heartless."
		Neera: "More heartless than cold-blooded murder?"
			"What do you think, Aylmera?"
		[Execute him.]
		[Slice tongue.]
	d. Bard: "Lotta blood flows in your wake."
		"'Course that makes it safer to travel behind you..."
18. Ramparts
19. Aether Ruins
	a. When encountering Morcant, the undead Prince
		Prince: "To create... is to... consume..."
			~ Alexandros recognizes this as a phrase that the Mad Wizard frequently spoke. He's horrified/perplexed why Morcant's remains know/speak it.
			~ It's likely one of the last phrases uttered by the Mad Wizard before his inevitable demise.
20. Great Tower Basement
	a. Comment from the Spirit of Aylmera
		"You wear my armor and wield my sword, yet you are not me." "Do you wish to mock me?"
	b. When the Spirit of Aylmera is revealed to the Player, the Priestess recognizes her voice as one of the many that God has spoken to her through.
		- As such, the Priestess feels it's a good omen, and is eager to hear the spirit out.
21. Aether Wasteland
22. The Garrison
	a. A conversation with the Eastern Coalition guardsmen on the opposite end of the Aether Ruins
		Called out from the garrison: "What the... You there! HALT! Don't take another step forward."
		*Aylmera stops walking* *Party appears from her, flanking her sides*
		Guardsman: "Who are you? What do you want?"
		Aylmera: "We're... just travelers." "We come on behalf of the Crown."
		Guardsman: "..."
		Guardsman: "Stay put. I'm coming down."
		Guardsman: "*muffled* ...And don't open it again unless I give the word..."
		*Large garrison door creaks open, with a single man exiting, before it promptly shuts behind him* (have sound effects for both opening and closing)
		Guardsman: "*The man looks you up and down, with a discerning eye.* " "I ask again: What do you want?"
		Aylmera: "I'm sorry, I don't understand... How... are you here?"
		Guardsman: "How are we here?! How are YOU here? WHY are you here?"
		Aylmera: "I- uh. We're just passing through."
		Guardsman: "I don't know where the hell you're from, but no one simply 'passes through' the hellscape that is West of this garrison."
			"So. Again: What. Are. You. Doing here?"
		Aylmera: "I suppose we were hoping to... travel past your garrison?"
		Guardsman: "No. Absolutely not."
		Guardsman: "I've been stationed here since the day your tower erupted into blue flames."
			"And in all those years, not a SINGLE lucid soul has ever approached this gate from the West."
		Guardsman: "But now, all of a sudden, four people walk out from that wasteland as though it were nothing."
			"And they want to pass through my gate?"
			"You're a dangerous bunch. The door stays closed."
		[You fear us?]
			Guardsman: "Not while we're on this side of the garrison."
				"And not with a dozen of my men aiming arrows at your skulls as we speak."
		[We come in peace.]
			Guardsman: "Peace? Is that how you refer to your genocide of a civil war?"
				"A peaceful skirmish? You're beyond delusional."
		Guardsman: "If, as you so boldy claim, you truly serve the Crown, then allow me to relay him a message."
			"A message, in fact, from the Eastern Coalition:"
		Guardsman: "He has failed to commune with the other member states by way of raven for well over two dozen seasons." (For context, he stopped sending updates BEFORE the Great Explosion. As the Coalition disapproved of his war against the wizards.)
		Guardsman: "AND he has failed to contain the conflicts of his Kingdom to the confines of his own borders."
		Guardsman: "Therefore, the coalition made a unanimous decision to excommunicate he and his lineage."
		Guardsman: "This renders all prior agreements null and void."
		Guardsman: "Should he make the foolish decision to enter coalition territory, he is to be promptly captured and executed for his crimes."
			"Any questions? Or was that all clear enough for you?"
		[The Eastern Coalition?]
			Guardsman: "Yes. The Coalition of nations to which your Kingdom once belonged. Before you mindlessly waged war against yourselves."
		[Two dozen seasons?]
			Guardsman: "Yes. More than six years. All of our hails have been met with silence."
		Guardsman: "Do yourself a favor, friends. Admit to yourselves you're lost. This ain't your home, you're not welcome here, so go back the way you came."
		- Note: The Guard should stay outside the gate (leaving it shut) until you leave the zone. Upon returning, it should be closed shut, with no one outside and with no further communication possible.
23. Royal Cemetary
24. Ruined Royal Castle

Concepts:
==========
1. "Don't fear what you don't know."
2. "Humility above all else."
3. "Treachery begets treachery."
4. "Cowardice reveals one's innermost doubts."
6. "Few wars, if any, are just."
7. "I feel dead inside and I am alone anyway."
8. "I am a product of my environment."
9. Player party has assassins sent after them, and is opposed by almost all other governing bodies (aside from the King).
	- A scene where the party is rolled up on by mounted assassins who just immediately attack could be very cool.
10. Player must kill the Leper colony in order to take their elemental orb.
	- Literally kill them ALL. (Some directly, others are assumed to die in the wake left behind.)
	- They're peaceful and just off on their own, trying to survive. Wanting nothing to do with the politics of the Realm (which has long abandoned them).
11. "Old World ideas cannot flourish or succeed in the harsh reality of the New World."
13. Swearing fealty to the King or not.
14. What if it had a Synthwave chiptune soundtrack?
	https://watchoutforsnakestheband.bandcamp.com/album/dis-integrate
		- Alt Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnMQAyCv0hc&list=OLAK5uy_n4qEMeeW5YX7ABN3RbA7i4GG_D6eBuzGQ
		- Whole album is good, but Time (Never Enough) is esp. good energy
		- Awake is also a good introspective tone
	https://samaleums.bandcamp.com/album/enter-the-megadungeon
		- Ascend The Tower has some good duties that seem to move in like a sign wave
		- Die has a good sound for something that could work as a Game Over screen
			~ Seems to use a violin + 4 notes on a duty for most of the track
15. Player is ambushed by a bossfight by a boss riding in on horseback out of nowhere and triggering the fight.
20. Deciding whether to slay or spare enemies after fighting them in battle.
	- Could have some characters ask for death. For honor, or because their armies are already decimated by you.
	- Others could beg for life.
	- Options could be "Converse" or "Kill" when interacting with them post battle.
		~ Or "Slay" vs "Spare"
22. Keep in mind how historians are unable to know of the intricate social details of people during their actual lives.
	- Apply this to the history that you discover about the world around you. Vital details get left out. Pieces get misattributed and rearranged over time.
24. A "Check-in" system for periodically talking to your party members. Allows you to talk with them and learn more about who they are and their histories.
	- Could occur manually in menus. Could occur auotmatically at savepoints?
25. "There are no heroes. Everyone has a skeleton... or two."
26. What if there were simulated "loading screens" of doors opening like in Resident evil for major zones?
	- Could easily just destroy the pace and feel sluggish, but could be worth experimentation.
27. "When starving, everyone will fight over the crumbs. No matter how meek or feeble they were prior."
29. Quotes from the Priestess on her God: "God comes to me in many forms. Sometimes as the wind, other times as a voice. Rather, as many voices. Often all at once."
	- "There are times when I hear nothing from him for days. And others where he talks nonstop for hours on end."
	- "It's rare for him to hear me, but I'm content listening to him. He has so much to share that I'm privileged by his enlightenment."
33. Asking Alexandros why he served the Mad Wizard if the Mad Wizard was such a chaotic man.
	- Alexandros, smiling longingly:
		"Everyone only remembers him for the Great Explosion. Even what's left of the wizardry fails to remember much more."
		"But to be in his presence, and to see what I saw first-hand... He was a true miracle-worker."
		"Though I can't speak to his... mental faculties, he seemed attuned with nature in a way I still fail to understand."
		"He was connected to something much bigger than the rest of us."
		"Spying on him one evening, I watched as he, using magic alone, grew a single seed into a magnificent sapling."
		"I watched intently as its branches sprawled upward higher and higher touching the ceiling until a canopy formed overtop the entire room."
		"And just as it seemed it would engulf everything, he stopped it. Used that same magic to reverse its growth and return it back into the seed."
		"He was crying while he did it. Tears of joy. Smiling and laughing to himself as he worked..."
		*Alexandros sighs*
		"I know few in the Realm would agree with me, but I often wonder to myself about the explosion."
		"Knowing what energies would be released in the blast, he still chose to do it. Trading all those lives, even his own, for this outcome."
		"If he willingly killed all those soldiers... all of us wizards... maybe he saw something we didn't?"
		"I can't say what other world would have instead awaited us. But who's to say it's a better one than this?"
		"After all, the Realm has had its fair share of cruel leaders..."
34. Asking the Jester about his relationship with the King
	- TBD. They are friends, he truly cares about the King.
	[When'd you first meet the King?]
	- Jester, pondering:
	"Let's see... close to 30 years ago now? I was part of a troupe that performed for him one of his birthdays."
	"I had recently finished my training at the college, and I was eager to impress him. I think he saw that in me, even back then."
	"Needless to say, my stunts and jokes landed well, and thus he offered me a full-time position in his court. A Royal Jester."
	"Naturally, I was taken aback. Stunned, really, I didn't know what to say. But luckily the leader of my troupe was a true friend, and replied for me, knowing better than to squander the opportunity."
	- Jester, laughing:
	"I later learned that the King found most funny my lack of modesty. My willingness to ridicule HIM in particular that evening."
	["And how'd you transition from entertainer to advisor?"]
	- Jester, smiling:
	"They're really much the same role at the end of the day. An entertainer's job is to stay abreast of today's politics."
	"To make jokes of serious matters. To point out the hypocrisy and lunacy of the daily schedule of the Crown."
	"I earned my fair share of lashings for saying too much... But more often than not, I earned respect for my commentary."
	["That doesn't add up. Even the most revered Jesters don't get to lead armies."]
	- Jester, sighing:
	"You're right. The war had left us strapped for leadership. And more importantly, for loyalty in the court. You see, we didn't strike the first blow against the wizards."
	"Prince Morcant had left the castle to recruit soldiers to our army, and the wizards must have known this, because within days of his absence their assassins struck."
	"Praise the Heavens they failed in their attempt on the King's life. But they took many royal guardsmen, councilmembers, and even nobles along with them."
	"So the Crown needed people. As the saying goes, those he 'could trust with both his coinpurse, and his life'. So he asked me to step up as one of his war-time advisors."
	["And how did you respond to his request?"]
	- Jester, laughing:
	"I laughed in his face. Thought he was joking. Sometimes he liked to try and make me laugh, you see. But he was dead serious."
	"He was... fearful. There were rumors going around about who had let the assassins in, and whether there would be more attempts on his life. All sorts of things were in turmoil."
	"But he was lucky, it turned out I had a knack for strategy. And when my strategies began to win battles, he urged me to command more and more of our army."
	"In the end, I was on the frontlines of the war. Commanding soldiers in the heartland of the enemy."
	["I don't get it. If you led troops on the frontlines and personally advised the King on matters of war, why don't the soldiers respect you more?"]
	- Jester, questioningly:
	"What's not to get? The Crown is merely a title without an army, it's about what he commands that gives him power and influence."
	"Our King barely rules the land his castle sits upon. If the soldiers don't respect HIM, why would they respect his right-hand man?"
	"It's troublesome... but the Crown isn't long for this world. Everyone sees that. Since he's too old to birth a new heir, everyone's just waiting for him to finally collapse."
	"Once that happens, they'll each get a chance to sit atop that cursed throne..."
	["Sounds like you're the only loyal one left in the court."]
	- Jester, sadly:
	"Yes. I suppose I am. It's part of what pains me about leaving his side..."
	- Jester, crying:
	"But what am I to do? Sacrifice myself for a man on his deathbed?"
	"Sacrifice the entire Realm for the safety of one, miserable old man?!"
	"It's a rotten hand he was dealt. His Kingdom has been robbed of everything precious to it."
	"He sits upon a throne of ashes... God help whoever claims it next."
	["I'm sure he knows of your profound loyalty."]
	- Jester, pausing:
	"I would hope. I've only ever wanted to do right by the Realm. A task that gets harder to do each and every day."
35. Asking the Priestess about what precisely she sees in the future
	- Neera, curtly:
	"I don't see the future all at once, God does not make me privy to such things."
	"I often wonder if he even has such powers himself..."
	"No, instead he offers me guidance. His voices tell me things, and each one shows a different path."
	[Does he lie?]
		Neera, laughing:
			"Certainly, some of his voices are real tricksters. God has an incredible sense of humor."
			"But I've learned to understand his humor, and know which of his voices are sincere."
	[Multiple voices?]
		Neera:
			"Yes. He speaks to me with many different tongues. But all have his intentions behind them."
			"Many times they speak all at once. I've trained myself to selectively listen, so as to hear the truth behind his words."
			"A scholar once described it as a 'Hivemind' of sorts. If God is like a bee, then I am happily his keeper."
			"The honeys he produces for me are bountiful. And they have yet to lead me astray."
		Aylmera: "More than just bees live in such colonies."
		Neera, lightly rebuffed:
			"You mean to imply he works as a wasp? Or perhaps a colony of... molerats?"
			"Though you mean to besmirch his methods, I assure you they are sound."
			"A hive knows the value of communal effort, and how to achieve collective goals."
			"Perhaps this discussion is meant as something for *you* to ponder. Rather than the other way around..."
38. Invasive questions from Old Scratch
	- Old Scratch (earlier on in the story):
	"Forgive me, but my memory's not as good as it used to be. How many dead is that now? Are we past double-digits?"
	- Old Scratch (after slaying the lepers):
	"Lepers. Even I didn't have the heart to do what you did. Is that why you did it? To feel merciful?"
	- Old Scratch (after killing the King)
	"Heh. You don't disappoint, you know that?"
	[It wasn't for you.]
		"Nevertheless, I still admire your handiwork."
	[You're welcome.]
		"You're quite the splendid one."
	"But. There's something eating away at me, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask..."
	"Why not take the throne? It's waiting for you. A seat ready to be warmed."
	[It's not for me.]
		"Maybe one day you'll recognize your mistake."
	[Then sit your scrawny ass in it.]
		"..."
		"I knew I liked you."
40. Some NPCs should be weary of the Player, as they're basically undead. Others should be ecstatic, because you're a Legendary Hero reborn.
	- This will only occur for those who learn of your undead nature. Most will have no clue.
		~ Or those who recognize that 'Aylmera' can really only refer to the ancient hero.
43. First encounter with Neera (Hivemind Priestess)
	Neera: "Excuse me travelers, I'd like a word with you..."
	*Neera approaches the player*
	Neera: "My name is Neera. I'm a hivemind cleric."
	Neera: "I've known of your arrival for some time now. And I was hoping to speak with you about your quest."
	Aylmera: "I don't know what you're talking about. We're just passing through the area."
	*Neera smiles*
	Neera: "No need to be coy with me. He's told me everything I need to know about you."
	Aylmera: "Huh? What's she on about, Jester? Do you know this woman?"
	Jester: "No. I'm as confused as you. What are you talking about, priestess?"
	Neera: "About the undead horde, and your plans to stop it."
	*Aylmera is puzzled (?)*
	Jester: "Damn bandits must've spread the word... Careful, she could be one of their scouts."
	Neera: "You would be wrong. It was God who told me of your arrival."
	Jester: *Laughing* "Excuse me? *God* told you?"
	Neera: "Yes. God speaks with me often, sharing his immeasurable wisdom."
		"Though he takes many forms, sometimes all at once, his message is always clear."
	Jester:	"Let's get out of here. This woman is clearly unwell."
	Player: [She's a lunatic.] [I believe her.]
	*Neera smiles*
	Neera: "I assure you I'm as lucid as the both of you, Aylmera. I speak only the truth."
		"How else would I know your name? Or that of your companion. Right, Sigmund?"
	Jester: *Is alarmed (!)*
	Neera: "Or that you have a third companion, Alexandros, who's responsible for your revival. And awaits you to the far North."
	Jester: "This must be some kind of trick. None of this proves you have foresight!"
	*Neera sighs (bored/...)*
	Neera: "The Lord told me you would be difficult to persuade, Jester. Which is why he shared details of your history with me."
			"I was told of your devotion to the Crown. And of your friendship with the late Prince."
			"Even of the promise you made to the King before marching on the Great Tower. The one he whispered in your ear..."
			"Shall I recite it for you?"
	Jester: *Stunned, pausing (...)*
	Jester: "I don't believe it... what kind of witchcraft is this?"
	Neera: "'No matter the cost to our armies...'"
	Jester: "Stop. That's enough!"
	Neera: "'...bring my son home alive.'"
	Jester: *Annoyed (!!)*
	Jester: "Do you mean to mock me?!"
	Jester: "I said ENOUGH, damn it! Have you no compassion?!"
			"You speak of God, yet lack any ounce of soul!"
	* Aylmera pauses (...)*
	Aylmera: "Sigmund..."
	Aylmera: "Given your response... "
		"It sounds like she's telling the truth."
	Aylmera: "God or not, she knows more than she should."
	Neera: "Indeed. And there's something more I wish to know, Aylmera."
		"Who do you think is fit to rule this Realm?"
	[The King.]
		Neera: "Hmmm. We'll see if that resolve holds for the remainder of our journey."
	[I don't know.]
		Priestess: *Laughs*
		Priestess: "Well, you might not have been born in this era, but you certainly belong to it."
			"It's unease permeates even your ancient being."
	Neera: *Pausing (...)*
	Neera: "Listen. I understand that my methods are... unusual."
		"And that my insistence on accompanying you may be off-putting, but..."
	Neera: *Frowns sorrowfully*
	Neera: "In the visions bestowed upon me, I've seen you die a thousand deaths. Both of you."
		"Most occur long before your journey's completion'."
		"Yet the only outcomes where anyone survives are when I am by your side."
		"Take me with you, so that we may see your journey to its conclusion."
		"So that we may save the Realm from total ruin."
	Aylmera: "Sounds like we've little choice in the matter. Sigmund?"
	Jester: "Despite my better judgement, I think she could prove useful to us."
	Neera: *Smiles*
	Neera: "Then it's settled, I shall accompany you from here on out."
	* Neera, the hivemind cleric, has joined the party! *
46. A medical priestess who patches you up partway through the game:
	* Perhaps she is who mends you after her group rescues you from drowning in the river.
	Nurse: "Warrior, you're awake!"
	Aylmera: "Ugh, my head..." 
	Nurse: "Sit still a moment while you collect yourself."
	[Who are you?]
		Nurse: "I'm a priestess. Medically trained. I was tending to your wounds while you healed."
		Nurse: "Some of the men found you by the riverbank and brought you in..."
	[Where am I?]
		Nurse: "Atro. A small village that runs along the river. Some men found you by the riverbank and brought you in..."
	Nurse: "You're lucky to even be alive. That armor you wear is some of the heaviest I've ever seen."
		"I don't know how it didn't drag you to the bottom. You must have one hell of a Guardian Angel."
	Nurse: *pauses (...)*
	Nurse: "Look. I've never been one for deception, so I'll just be blunt."
	Nurse: "Your body carries with it the scars of a thousand battles, and yet I've hardly seen flesh as youthful or resilient."
		"At the same time, your breathing was labored, and at times you bled from your nose and mouth..."
		"I don't mean to pry, warrior, because you scare me. But... just what are you?"
	Aylmera: "I'm undead. Brought back to life through magick."
	Nurse: "What?! But you're no dessicated husk. I've seen the handiwork of a necromancer before."
	Nurse: "Nor are you eager to tear me apart like those cursed with Aether..."
	Aylmera: "I speak no lies. The most powerful wizard alive brought me back from the dead."
		"I'm the hero Aylmera."
	* Nurse is alarmed/gasps (!) *
	Nurse: "Oh my! Your injuries are more severe than I realized."
		"Delusions like this can be a rare side effect of-"
	Aylmera: "Miss!"
	* Nurse pauses (...) *
	Aylmera: "I assure you. I am of sound mind."
		"I was revived on the King's orders."
		"He asked for my assistance. I'm to save the Realm."
	Aylmera: "I might be the only one who can stop the Aether horde."
	Nurse: "Oh. Oh my... "
		"I don't know what to say. To think such a thing is even possible..."
		"You know, if you really are Aylmera, my ancestors once built a shrine to you."
		"The legends say you were the last good thing to happen to the Realm."
		"I fear such a thing may be true now more than ever..."
		"If you really are who you say, then be wary of who you tell your story." 
		"These lands are hardly friendly to the King, let alone wizards and their... experiments."
	Aylmera: "I'll keep it in mind. "
		"Thank you for healing me."
	Nurse: "Do take things slow, hero."
		"You've been out cold for a while."
		"Your success may depend upon your patience."
	* Aylmera gets out of bed. Player resumes control. *
47. General note on the introspections of the main party
	* Something that should quickly dawn on the player (and all other main characters) is that saving the Kingdom has little value while the Kingdom still lacks an heir.
		- As such, opportunities will arise where characters will begin to scheme for who and what will take over following the King's death (natural or otherwise).
50. "Only the dead can purge the sins of the living."
	- Does this really match what I'm trying to say overall? Does it even add up with the player's actions?
52. Perhaps combine the Bard and Ol' Scratch into a hybrid character of sorts.
	- One who perfects their craft as they travel in your wake.
	- They comment on your actions, with a sinister flair.
	- They play a melancholy tune that makes it immediately evident when they're in the area.
	- They judge the player for their violent actions, in a teasing manner.
53. Early on, when getting gear from the King's armory, the soldiers there should express doubts about your skills.
	- Despite her fabled weapon being a Greatsword, the player doesn't know how to properly wield one.
	- This serves as a way for them to teach you the basics of combat. (Though make this sequence optional for replays)
		~ Could mention real facts about Greatswords. E.g. On the grip: The top hand pushes, while the bottom hand pulls
55. Have a scene of undead sailors rising from the waves on the beach coming to attack the player
56. Add in a zone (possibly the 4th stone location?) of the Royal catacombs
	- These were raided by the wizards prior to the Great Explosion
	- Due to its proximity to the Great Tower, and its abundance of bodies, it's rife with undead.
	- It has an awful omen to it. Even Alexandros doesn't wish to enter it.
57. As the game progresses the non-human enemies should become more grotesque (flesh golems, etc.)
	- Meanwhile the humans encountered become more beautiful and/or "civil" on the surface in how they behave.
		~ This is to underline how their actions are so grotesque and awful, but they are seeming unaffected by their own treachery.
	- Starting with Lepers and Vivian (who is maimed) kind of aligns with this.
	- Moving to the Lord and the Monastery also works well for it.
	- Overall, this is a difficult theme to accomplish and seems a bit of a lofty goal.
58. Encountering the statue of Aylmera should trigger a cutaway to a full screen view of the statue along with a text description.
	- "The inscription reads: 'In memory of Aylmera, Martyr of Antiquity and Hero to the Realm.'"
		~ Reveal this detail BEFORE the description of the statue below, so the final line is "...she looks nothing like you."
	- "Before you stands a statue of a woman adorned in decorative armor. Its metal scales are intricately woven together, hanging cleanly around her graceful body, accentuating her beauty."
	- "Her posture is that of an elegant fighter, with a face that is fierce yet soft. She is the most beautiful woman you have ever seen. And she looks nothing like you."
	- The party splits to discuss the obvious discrepancy between you and "your" statue.
		~ Two main responses could be: [Flattered.] or [Confused.]/[Concerned.]
59. "I would kill you all if only to save myself."
61. Instead of HP use "Morale".
63. Each of the main areas (dictated by having a unique Boss) should have an overall theme to the plot.
	- Castle = Neglect/Ruination
		~ Everything should have an aire of falling apart.
		~ Soldiers stretched thin. Nobles entirely unprepared for and unaware of the imminent danger that looms.
		~ Not enough staff or supplies to fully manage the castle.
		~ No one paying attention to the problems ACTIVELY being faced by the castle. Still just concerned with the war that has already ended.
		~ And certainly no concern for the peasantry outside the walls.
	- Forest = Opportunism/Opportunity
		~ They claim to want to uplift the peasantry, but have yet to do it. There seriousness of their pursuit can be questioned.
		~ The Jester taking advantage of you not knowing all the details of the plan.
	- Mountain Caves = Judgment Vol. 1
		~ The Bloodhound trying to judge you for himself.
			~ Despite pursuing his own form of Justice, it is blind and unjust. It tries to Moralize a very Grey world.
	- Lepers = (False) Hope/Trickery
		~ Despite the hope of all these people, they ultimately want to indoctrinate you. They ignore reason over their blind faith.
		~ They wish to manipulate you into abandoning your mission. (Which represents abandoning everyone else in favor of a selfish minority.)
		~ The irony is that they themselves have been abandoned by the whole (the Realm).
			~ The player should mention how the Crown "never mentioned anyone living all the way out here".
		~ The Apothecary, of course, manipulates and tricks the Lepers into treating him as a savior and a leader.
			~ Though all he provides is various placebo. (Something Neera reveals, as she understands medicine well.)
		~ It also represents the DEATH of hope, when you inevitably kill the Apothecary and all his loyal followers.
	- Highlands = Oppression
		~ Chaingangs work the land for the Lord.
		~ They are ruled by cruel knights.
		~ The slaves' crimes are not even that severe, nor morally wrong.
	- Swamp = Mystery/The Unknown
		~ This is also where the player begins to LEARN of their own mystery (their identity).
	- Coastal Village = Loss/Abandonment/Hopelessness also Judgment Vol. 2
		~ Undead soldiers rising from the sea to fight you shows the magnitude of the Aetherial threat.
			~ Illustrates how this might just be a hopeless endeavor if so much has already been destroyed.
		~ The mass suicide shows the hopelessness as well as the loss of life.
		~ The evident famine shows the loss of basic needs.
		~ The party themselves must take the orb and leave, abandoning the bodies and the memories of the villagers.
		~ The Bloodhound is reminded of his own loss, and decides to act once again as the Hand of Justice in this world.
	- Aether Ruins = Chaos/Savagery
		~ Pure, unfiltered violence and aggression. A wasteland of raw violence and war. Mindless creatures roam wild.
		~ The Garrison illustrates how even 'civilized' people are savage in their refusal to deal with you.
		~ The Prince demonstrates both his present chaos, and the savagery he once committed.
			~ Were it not for his willingness to attempt an assassination, his body would not be roaming this landscape at all.
		~ The Spirit of Aylmera herself represents the Chaos of history and of what we think we know.
			~ She reveals the truth of the protagonist's story, and with it upsets the little solid understanding of the world the party thought they had.
	- Royal Catacombs = Peace/The Past
		~ Perhaps the only remotely peaceful zone in the game.
		~ "Only the dead may know peace."
		~ Even then, there is evidence of the Wizards' attempts to disrupt that by stealing corpses.
			~ Long abandoned undead should still work in the catacombs and nearby mines, etc. Extracting goods from the earth. Now for no purpose.
			~ Despite the fact that their masters long abandoned them (or died).
			~ The undead continue tirelessly as a reminder of the now broken empire the Wizards attempted to build. (And its great moral cost).
		~ Witnessing the undead still at work should offend the Jester and Neera (and perhaps the player) at Alexandros.
			~ "You observed all this happening and did nothing? This is consecrated earth, all these skeletons earned their peace."
			~ "How can they cross the styx if they still toil to this day?!" - Neera
		~ These catacombs could have caverns that weave in and out of the mines. New paths, which the wizards forged for faster material extraction.
		~ Interacting with the undead here should just have them silently stare at you for a moment, before returning to their work.
			~ They're soulless automatons.
	- Castle Finale = Destruction/Finality
		~ The King is dead, his body a crumpled corpse at the foot of his own throne.
			~ The Bandit Queen sits proudly atop his throne, eager to greet you.
		~ The castle is in flames. The nobles and soldiers have all died or fled.
			~ The castle itself is now seriously damaged, unable to be defended properly.
		~ Throughout the game, the player learns there isn't a single person deserving enough to rule the Realm.
			~ But at the end, they realize they've killed everyone CAPABLE of even ruling it.
			~ The only thing left is "To return it to dust and ash." ("Ye whose bones belong as DUST and ASH.")
				~ You should utter this phrase to the Bandit Queen.
65. For some key fights use a unique battle scene, one that's larger or has obstacles inside of it.
	~ Perhaps even use different ones for different world environments.
	~ This will change things up AND can be used to throw off the player to create a more pressing fight.
66. The Lord has weaponized the Church.
	- And in turn the Church has allowed itself to be weaponized.
	- The main religious leader (a cardinal-esque figure?) stands at odds to Neera.
		~ Neera: "God speaks ill of you. He even agrees with himself on that."
		~ Cardinal: "Listen to yourself, Heretic! You speak nonsense as though it were scripture!"
					"It will be a mercy to send your soul to the afterlife."
67. Change the color of enemies (their palettes) to show they're vulnerable in combat.
	- E.g. a character could swap to a different color when exhausted, or when there's an opening in their pattern.
	- Otherwise, have them be invulnerable.
	- Explain this mechanic via the combat tutorial. (And make that whole thing brief.)
68. "Better to bend than to break."
69. "I have no quarrel with you."
70. Living through a time that is the calm before the storm. After having already lived through a brutal storm.
71. Adjust the palette of the party depending on the lighting of the scene they're currently in.
	- Is it a dark cavern? Maybe use darker blacks/grays/blues.
	- Is it well light and outdoors? Use warmer reds and oranges.
	- Is it a spooky or alien area? Color them in strange, luminscent greens.
73. As the player moves further away from the main castle (and the story progresses) the built structures should be more worn down.
	- So adjust tilemaps to have floor tiles missing pieces, or fenceposts broken, etc. etc.
	- The one exception should be in the Lord's land, where everything is well-maintained.
74. Color interactable objects differently from their backgrounds to make it obvious they're interactable.
75. "Peace cannot stem from an occupied throne. May its seat remain forever empty."
76. What if Aylmera's body began to deteriorate over the course of the story.
	- This would force urgency, and a feeling of despair.
	- Could start with things like minor bleeding, and end with limb paralysis and similar things.
		~ Bleeding from forehead, eyes, ears, nose.
		~ Coughing up blood.
		~ Stiffness in limbs.
		~ Blacking out.
	- But she'd still need to be able-bodied enough to engage in combat up until the very end.
	- Maybe she could be forced to rest for a day or so at one point.
	- This helps tie the plot in to the Intro and her reawakening.
	- Alexandros can theorize that the ritual was unstable, and he can tell you don't have many days left.
	- Overall, the player should be urged to fulfill the mission set out in the prologue: Silence the living's burdens, return to the fold, and then Arise.
		~ There needs to be a way that the player learns more about this "prophecy" of sorts. Or rather, about how this afterlife seems to work.
		~ Alexandros could learn that he mistook it for a "Healing" ritual, but it's a "Morality Healing" ritual. (Need better phrasing on that long-term)
			~ It's meant to give someone an opportunity to repent and remedy the harm done in their lifetime.
		~ Basically, he thought the Healing referred to what he was doing, and not to an exchange expected of the sacrifice (Aylmera).
	- The player needs to reasonably be able to interpret that Silencing the living's burden means bringing peace to the Realm.
	- This allows the player to die near the end of the game and bring the story some solid closure.
77. "I am still a beast whose actions are dictated by stimuli."
78. "Killers make terrible leaders."
79. Add a "Book of the Dead" to the castle chapel, which has its most recent entries in the current year.
	- Notably, it includes "Morcant", the prince of the realm.
	- Or perhaps it notably EXCLUDES him, as his body was never recovered?
80. Add stained glass windows to the chapel, each detailing a piece of the Realm's history.
	- Have at least one relate to the escapades of Aylmera in her past life.
81. Thoughts to hear/experience from the void:
	- "When the curtain finally falls on your forlorn existence. For whom will you cry?"
	- "How will death find you in your final moments? Steadfast? Broken? Unwilling?"
82. Have a character that just insults you offhand, and then give the options:
	- Ideally, have this be after the player has gone through some real brutal/rough part of the story.
		~ It should be at a moment when they don't feel like taking shit from anyone.
	- [Kill him.] or [I'm not a psycho.]
	- To be clear, there should be no real reason to kill this person. It's a gross over-escalation.
		~ It's meant to be a bit of a funny interaction.
83. "You ever heard the story of the Great Phoenix? The mythical bird that burned to a crisp, yet was birthed anew from its ashes."
	- "Though miraculous, it was the last of its kind. People say it went mad searching for a mate."
	- "It would sing its mating call deep into the night, awaiting a reply that never came."
	- "Such is the fate of those who outlive their kin. They are doomed to wander an aimless path alone."
	- "Are we any more found than the Great Phoenix...?"
	- This is all based on the idea of the The Last Kauai ‘Ō’Ō Bird In 1987
		~ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45csJ9IO0v4
84. Have certain equippable weapons have different elemental affinities.
	- And have these deal different levels of damage to different opponents based on triangles of super effectiveness.
86. "Love, there's no question of who you stand for. The question is: Why don't they stand for YOU?"
	- A character to Aylmera when discussing loyalties.
87. To give the impression of different voices, play different audio tracks for different speech types.
	- For example, a character that has a low, gravelly voice should have lower doots to the text being spoken.
		~ I say, "doots" referring to the little noises made while speaking in place of actual narration (due to GBC limitations.)
		~ Think of something like Animal Crossing as an example.
	- This will allow the tone of each character (and antagonist) to really shine through, and prevent them all from feeling the same.
	- For a key character/boss fight there could, maybe, be actual voice lines (think 'Mortis' from Faith)
88. Create an animation for Alexandros casting a magic spell (for use in the intro scene)
	- Have it be that both his hands are extended in front of him, with orbs of energy coming off them. (He'll be pointed at Aylmera as he's the one reviving her.)
90. What if the real Aylmera never served the King's lineage? What if he is the descendant of her long-time enemies?
	- But due to her beloved nature, they simply incorporated her as part of "their" realm. To prevent her from becoming a martyr.
	- This would give the Spirit of Aylmera reason to distrust the party even further.
91. Conversation with the artist (Giovanni) about the Mad Wizard and his role in the Great Explosion
	Aylmera: "Why did he blow it up?"
	Giovanni: "What do you think? He saw what came next. Opted for a roll of the dice instead."
	Alexandros: "How could you be certain of that? Did he tell you such a thing?"
	Giovanni: "I can't be certain, not 100%. But a man like that? With such mastery of his talents? The explosion was no accident."
	Alexandros: "At least on that we agree."
	Jester: "I still don't understand."
	Neera: "I do. Seeing ahead into the future... it's easy to find unwelcome truths. Routes and paths you'd never wish to venture."
		"Outcomes you'd prefer to avoid. But some are easier to prevent than others. Perhaps he was simply out of options."
	Alexandros: "Assuming that's true, do you think he could have known what came next following his actions?"
		"Could he have foreseen the way things would be now? Is that how you see, Neera?"
	Neera: "No... No. What I envision is glimpses of different pathways. Rarely do I see much all at once."
		"Imagine it like a series of doors. I can spend time glancing inside a handful, and if I see something I dislike, then I can slam it shut in the present."
		"But to look inside every door, well, that would take an eternity. I can only look ahead as long as I spend time meditating on such possibilities."
	Giovanni: "Wizard. Did you ever see your mentor control time? Such a practice might have allowed him more time to see more options..."
	Alexandros: "Yes, but also no. He performed brief moments of time distortion, yes. But I never witnessed something over a prolonged period."
	Jester: "So he took a gamble on a future he didn't know, instead of an awful one of which he was certain?"
		"Then it's possible he made the wrong decision."
	Alexandros: (Angry) "It's just as possible he made the right one."
	Neera: "Gentlemen. Your bickering serves no one. Remember that all we have is each other."
	* Jester pauses (...) *
	Jester: "*Sigh* You know, Alexandros. When you arrived at the castle, despite most the wizards being beaten and downtrodden, you held on to your old beliefs."
		"Many of the others seeking refuge groveled and even apologized to the Crown. Must've felt guilt for what had happened."
		"But not you, you remained loyal to the Mad Wizard and his teachings."
	* Jester laughs *
	Jester: "I held great contempt for you. Even advised the King to turn you and your kind away. Said you weren't worth the trouble."
		"However. I see now that you and I are two sides of a coin. Both committed to faith in our ideas and their leadership."
		"Albeit following different masters, our technique is much the same. With intentions to match."
		"What I mean is... I truly doubt we're that contrary to one another."
	* Alexandros pauses (...) *
	Alexandros: "I appreciate that. It's been difficult to find like-minds after the explosion."
	* Alexandros starts crying *
	Alexandros: "We lost... so much... in that fire. Guess I never really got a chance to mourn it."
		"We should get going. Thank you, Giovanni. For all your insights."
	* Giovanni smiles lightly *
	Giovanni: "The pleasure has been all mine."
	- If attempting further dialogue with Giovanni, display: "There's nothing more to say.""
92. Main internal conflicts for each party member to come to terms with
	a. Aylmera
		- Lost.
		- Who is she actually, and what does she need to do to redeem her soul.
		- Why was she brought back to life if not to save the Realm?
		- Though her actions stop one apocalypse, they almost certainly doom the Realm and its people.
			~ How is that a better outcome than when she was first reawakened?
	b. Jester
		- Cowardice.
		- Watched his men die in the explosion and immediately abandoned them.
			~ Left, most notably Morcant the Prince.
		- Fails to have the guts to tell the King to step down. To find a new solution to ruling the Realm.
			~ Wonders who should rule the Realm when the King is now unfit?
			~ How should be be removed from power when he isn't evil, but is causing harm?
	c. Neera
		- Confusion.
			~ She talks about how neither God nor the church listen to her.
			~ Though she can hear God, more often than not he ignores her direct questions.
			~ Why must she be blessed with his gift, but cursed to have no one believe in its truth?
			~ Why doesn't god perform a miracle for them?
		- How can she save the Realm when so much of the future is in flux? Which voices can she trust in her mind?
			~ How can she serve a multi-headed (so-to-speak) God? Its will is unimaginable. Moreover, most others have lost faith. How can she restore its greatness?
			~ I feel that Neera's conflict is the weakest of the bunch. This needs more thought/refinement.
				~ What if she struggles with knowing whether she's really changing things for the better?
				~ Maybe she feels that interfering with the future has caused her to be in control of something well beyond her abilities.
				~ And she fears she's potentially changed things for the worse, with no way of knowing for certain one way or the other.
				~ This can draw a parallel between her and the Mad Wizard. As both alter the course of events in the main plot.
	d. Alexandros
		- Shame.
		- How can he believe in the ideals of a man who went crazy and started an apocalypse?
		- Why did the Mad Wizard kill everyone? What good can come from magic if it only seems to end in destruction?
			~ In a sense, he's debating the question of progress. Magic has tangible benefits, but they only seem to be used for harm. How can such a thing be repurposed only for good?
			~ And furthermore, WAS the Mad Wizard good? Or was Alexandros duped by him all along? He still holds faithful, but has serious doubts festering.
93. Bossfight dialogue with Velazquez
	* Note: I think Alexandros should be broken out of jail
	Velazquez: "Well now, what have we here? Two lovely ladies and a jester waltzing in unannounced?"
		"It must be my lucky day, my men are in dire need of fresh entertainment."
		"And it just so happens that some of my best men..."
		"Hate. Women."
	Aylmera: "Sounds like they're not the best men."
	*Velazquez smiles*
	Velazquez: "Would you care to find out?"
	Velazquez: "Men, kill these fools."
	* Combat with some of his lackeys ensues.* *The the following dialogue after player wins.*
	Velazquez: "My oh my. I underestimated your prowess. Who taught you to use that blade?"
	Aylmera: "We're just here for the orb. Nothing more."
	*Velazquez laughing *
	Velazquez: "This bitch thinks she can make demands!"
		"I can't wait to teach some goddamn manners, darling."
		"Bring me the swordsman alive. Dispatch the others!"
	* Second engagement of lackeys ensues.* *Player wins*
	*Velazquez is angry *
	Velazquez: "Fucking cowards. You see? This is what lack of discipline does to a man. Robs him of his ambition."
		"He must learn to take what he's deserved. Nevering stopping to ask. He must rend it from the hands of the unworthy."
		"Lest he find himself lacking. Don't you agree?"
	[Man, shut up.]
	[I'm gonna maim you.]
	* Bossfight with Velazquez begins* *Player wins*
	Velazquez: "*cough* What's... the matter...? Can't... finish... the job...? *cough cough*"
	[Leave him.]
		Velazquez: "Heh... Knew you... lacked the courage..."
	[Dismember him.]
		"(You slice off both of his arms. And then both of his legs. He screams in pain.)"
		*Velazquez screams in pain.*
		Jester: "What the hell are you doing, Aylmera?!"
		Aylmera: "It's for his men. This is the only type of message his kind will understand."
		* Jester is shocked/horrified. *
	Interacting with Velazquez's body: "(He can no longer speak. He'll succumb to his wounds shortly.)"
94. At the encounter with Velazquez, he should give his elemental stone to the High Priest, who promptly leaves with it.
	- Velazquez basically saying, "Take it, I'll handle these pawns from the King in the meantime."
	- The party should see this exchange happen, and watch the High Priest leave with it. Meaning they're left fighting solely for their and Alexandros' survival.
	- Additionally, this allows me to flesh out an entire Cathedral/Monastery zone, where Neera can have some lore.
		~ What if she used to be a member, but was cast out in disgrace?
		~ What if she's a priestess of death. Communing with other-worldly entities and praying for the deaths of many evil-doers in the world?
			~ An ideology too extreme for the church?
			~ But the church itself should be established as evil. What if it's the reversal? She's cast out for not reforming her beliefs to match theirs.
			~ But what ARE the church's core guiding principles? This needs to be elaborated on.
95. "My Gods are older than you. Older than your empire. Older than honor itself. You've no right to dictate their will."
96. "It's called a bastard sword for a reason. One mistake with it, and you'll leave your sons fatherless. Well, not in your case. But you get the idea."
97. "Your presence dishonors us."
98. "You better not fucking fail us. Not that it matters."
	- Misc. Realm soldier aware of Aylmera's journey.
99. "I ain't wasting good gear on a corpse. You're lucky I'm even sparing you this."
	- Stated by the Quartermaster when he gives you starting gear in the castle armory.
100. The party stands above a cliff, overlooking the starting castle, now on fire. They're enroute to it.
	- Party stares in silence for a second or two.
	*Jester pauses (...)*
	Jester: "The castle..."
	Neera: "Do you... think we can make it in time?"
	Jester: "No."
	Alexandros: "No."
	[No.]
		*Whole party keeps staring at the castle.*
	[Yes.]
		*All other party members turn to look away from the view, staring at Aylmera.*
		Neera: "I must admit. Even *I'm* not optimistic about this one. My foresight eludes me."
	Alexandros: *turns to face the Jester* "We can stop who's responsible for this, Sigmund."
	Jester: "No... No you can't. The one responsible is sitting atop that throne... The one responsible is the Crown."
		"And he's likely sitting in that castle, dead as a doornail..."
	Alexandros: "Still, I just mean that we can-"
	Jester: *turns to face Alexandros* "I know. But this... this was always the outcome."
		"Whoever landed the final blow is unimportant. But I must know what has become of him... For certain."
		"And alas... there's nowhere to go but forward."
101. "THEY'RE ALL WASHED UP AND DOING BAD, NOT ME THOUGH!" - Comedic line from a random NPC somewhere.
102. Have the soundtrack for the Monastery boss fight sound similar to Monk chants.
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-hrBhA4XkM
103. Conversation with the void following your ultimate death.
	- This should be some of the final lines of dialogue in the entire game.
	Void: "...She returns to us once more... Hello, weary warrior."
	Aylmera: "I must know... Will the Realm survive without me? Were my actions in vain?"
	Void: "It is not our position to judge such a trivial matter."
	Aylmera: "But you *do* know the answer."
	Void: "...Of course. Yet such judgements do not concern thee."
	Aylmera: "Tell me. I beg of you!"
	Void: "...Thy soul is redeemed. Be free from the bondage of thine memories."
	Void: "Lest ye be driven mad with anguish. A ghost amidst the chaos."
	- Additional questions the player could ask:
	[Who will claim the throne?]
		Void: "Someone unfit for leadership."
104. "Death is inescapable, why isn't pain?"
	- Line from a misc character. The idea here is that pain BEING escapable (at least temporarily) makes its presence all the more agonizing.
	- If it were truly inescapable, then it might be easier to deal with. As there'd be a comfort in the inability to do anything about it.
	- The fact that it CAN be mitigated, centers blame on the individual experiencing it. Because why CAN'T they prevent their own suffering?
106. General note on the Jester
	- He is primarily seen as his career (Jester) before he is seen as a person (Sigmund).
	- As such, very few characters should ever refer to him by name. Most should simply call him 'jester'.
	- It's mainly the other members of the party which should refer to him by name.
109. Side note for the Lost Paladin
	* Note: Give the paladin a custom avatar. Make him feel important, but don't explain or elaborate on why.
		~ A cross or bible might work well for this.
	- In his own story, when he arrives at the Eastern Garrison, he collapses from exhaustion at the gate. The guards inspect his body and intend to destroy it (via cremation).
	- Except, they notice that his armor bears the insignia of the Eastern Coalition. (As it's where he originally trained.) As such, they bring him inside, and give him medical aid.
110. Notes on the lead up to the Storming of the Great Tower
	* Perhaps some of these details can be revealed by finding a tree full of ravens, with notes that were left on the ground by the birds (when the King ignored them).
	- In an attempt to avoid total bloodshed, the Coalition (despite having not heard from the King via raven in years) offered to send troops/supplies to assist the King in sieging the Tower.
		~ Their plan (and terms) were that the wizards remain unharmed. They wanted to see a (more) peaceful end, via starving the wizards into submission.
		~ They also insisted that the King offer amnesty to all the wizards when they ultimately lost.
	- Obviously, the King and his son instead chose to violently attack the wizards in the night, triggering the Great Explosion.
111. "Your cowardice betrays you, Jester. Tell me... who else has it betrayed?" *wicked smile*
112. Have a dialogue choice that's between [Run.] and [RUN!!!].
	- Would be perfect for a miniboss in the Aether Ruins. Something like a flesh golem.
113. Final dialogue choice for the player as they die.
	[Bury me.] or [Burn me.] (perhaps 'Cremate' is a better term)
	Aylmera: "I won't know peace... until my bones... can be forgotten..."
114. Crazed man. (This whole thing needs work, but I like some bits conceptually)
	- "I want out. Look at me, man! I want OUT. Outta this shit! I can't take it anymore. I gotta FUCKING. LEAVE."
	[Laugh]
		"You're stuck, pal. There's miles and miles of undead surrounding you in every direction."
	[Sympathize]
		"There's not a pathway out. You'll have to make peace with what you have here. There's nothing more we can do for you."
	"You think I don't know that? But LOOK at me. REALLY look. My mind has decayed more rapidly than my body. There ain't nothing left!"
115. The fishing village should have a mass suicide that took place prior to the party's arrival.
	- It could be in response to all the fish washing up dead. Remnants of offerings to old gods should be seen around.
	- Starving, some of the people chose to kill themselves. They couldn't flee through the bog as the undead inside proved too threatening.
	- Additionally, undead sailors started coming out of the ocean ransacking the town.
	- This village symbolizes the Loss of Hope. An unwillingness to continue onward. It stands in stark contrast to the party.
	- Encountering the Bloodhound here, amidst the bodies:
		* Note: The goal is to have him subtley reveal that he thinks Aylmera is the same killer from his past. And despite him knowing it can't be real, he has to be certain. He feels FORCED to kill you.
		* I don't like a ton of what I've written here. I want him to drop hints, then to surprise the player with a fight. Focus on that.

		Bloodhound: *Laughing* "I knew I smelled you coming. Even amidst all this death."
		Aylmera: "Didn't expect to find you here. It's a grim place to meet."
		Bloodhound: "I couldn't agree more. Why are you here?"
		Aylmera: "We've come for that blue orb. Then we'll be on our way."
		*Camera pans slightly to the orb, atop an altar at the center of the bodies. Bloodhound turns to it, then back to Aylmera.*
		Bloodhound: "Oh. It's important to you? Sure seems like it was important to all these folks too."
			"Well, then by all means. Seems they haven't much use for it now anyhow..."
		*Aylmera walks past the Bloodhound, who watches her as she moves, and takes the orb from the altar before walking away*
		Bloodhound: *sniff* "..."
		Bloodhound: "You know, I never did tell you this earlier..."
		* Aylmera stops, and turns toward him*
		Bloodhound: "In my old age, it's often hard to remember things. Especially about my past. And about my youth."
		Bloodhound: "But when I met you, it all rushed back to me. I couldn't place it at first. It was all jumbled up."
		Bloodhound: "Now though... NOW I remember. I remember my village. I remember... that man. I remember his face, his scent, the time of day, everything."
		Bloodhound: "And I just wanted to... thank you... for reminding me of who I am. Of why I'm here. One's history is deeply important."
		[You're welcome.]
		[Sure thing.]
		Bloodhound: "But uh... it's really about just that. That history. I know I'm old now, and you're so young... and feminine... and..."
		Bloodhound: "And, I mean, it's crazy, I know. I just figured you and I could be... I don't know. Nevermind. I'm sorry... "
		(The goal here is to give the impression that Aylmera/The Player thinks they're being hit on.)
		Aylmera: "Uh huh. We're leaving now."
		Bloodhound: "..."
		(Talking with him after this point, should also just have him say "...")
		*Control returns to the player, who walks south to leave, tripping a trigger*
		* Camera perhaps pans back to the Bloodhound who walks closer to the player again*
		Bloodhound: *cries* "Before, I was just so lost... So unsure. But now, you've made me certain. I'm sorry, I didn't think I'd get so emotional..."
		[I'm honored.]
		[We must be going.]
			(Secretish, only if 'Sure thing.' is also answered above as well)
			Bloodhound: *sniff* "Tell me. Do you know what comes next?"
			[Of course.]
				Bloodhound: "And yet you still humor an old man?"
				*Bloodhound smiles*
				Bloodhound: "I sincerely hope I'm wrong about you."
				* Charges into battle, facing the player.*
			[Of course not.]
				Bloodhound: "Oh. Right, of course. How foolish of me to even ask..."
		* Player again gets control and walks south to a trigger.*
		*Knife flies down toward the player.* (unless they engaged in the battle via the earlier dialogue)
		Bloodhound: "I can't just let you leave. Not again... I must to be certain."
		Aylmera: "What the HELL are you talking about?!"
		Bloodhound: "Quiet, witch! You bear his scent! If you aren't him, then you must be OF him."
			"I won't be made a fool twice. Not when your stench permeates every inch of this rotten earth!"
			"Don't you smell it?! I'm sorry... but I'm *certain* you must be stopped."
		* Dashes at the player, beginning the engagement * * Player wins *
		Bloodhound: "Maybe I... misremembered his scent..." (Dies.)

	<Misc tidbits that I might rework in later>
		Bloodhound: *sniff* "Goodbye. I'm sorry."
		*Control is returned to the player*
		*Player walks south to exit the screen, hitting a trigger*
		Bloodhound: "I'm sorry... for what comes NEXT!"
		* Dashes south across the screen into the player, triggering an engagement*
			(Alternately, throws a knife at the party, beginning the engagement)
		Bloodhound: "It's oddly pretty, isn't it?"
		[Yes]
			BH: "Yes, I thought you'd agree... You're more far gone than I'd first realized."
		[No]
116. Conversation with the High Priest
	* A core theme of the Monastery and the Lord's lands is misogyny. They're awful people.
	Priest: "You shouldn't be here. You should die and give the living a chance to save themselves. We don't need an outsider interfering with GOD!"
	Aylmera: "I'm not an outsider. Just like you, I was born in the Realm."
	Priest: "And unlike me, you DIED in it. Which is how you should remain. You're an affront to God"
	Neera: "You don't know of God's wishes. His silence has reigned over your church for well over a decade."
	Priest: "Save your delusions, witch! And remember your scripture!"
		"During the second century, God bestowed nothing but silence upon the church."
		"For more than 75 years, the papacy relied solely on blind faith for guidance."
		"An entire generation of priests loyal to a God whose voice they never heard!"
		"It is not our place to dictate his will. We must wait until he decides to commune with us."
	Neera: "But he communes with ME!"
	Priest: "HERESY! God does not and HAS NEVER communed with a woman. This is nothing more than a test of our faith."
		"And the church shan't fail, over the delusions of some blasphemous witch."
	Jester: "How else can you explain her foresight if not for the presence of some God?"
	Priest: "Ah, poor Jester. They've made a fool of you even more than your profession."
		"You think she's the first to come at my doorstep claiming miracles?"
		"You've all been made to look fools by a master manipulator. A temptress!"
	* Neera pauses* 
	Neera: "..."
	Neera: "Aylmera...?"
	Aylmera: "Yes, Neera?"
	Neera: "God says he needs to borrow your strength..."
	* Neera turns to face Aylmera *
	Neera: "He needs you to..."
		"Burn the high priest."
	* Aylmera charges into the priest, triggering combat *
	(Consider having dialogue after about whether God actually asked for that, or if Neera made it up.)
117. Dialogue with a misc enemy
	*Perhaps this occurs after they think they've mortally wounded Aylmera.*
	Enemy: "What was your name again?"
	Aylmera: "Aylmera."
	Enemy: "I'll ask for you when I get to hell. No hard feelings."
118. Saying 'No' to the King's request to undertake the quest.
	* If you tell him no, have him add a line of dialogue to both you and the Jester where he says to 'Keep an eye on her.' to Sigmund.
119. Encounters with the Bard
	* I would LOVE to have all of his lines be rhyming bar. Maybe not all, just lots. Have him tease you in rhyme.
	* Consider adding Music Note symbols to either side of his dialogue when he rhymes.
	* Also remember the Music Note emote that can go above his head.
	a. Before fighting Vivian (The Village)
		- He's sitting alone on the edge of the forest, if you try to walk past he sings a song about you.
		- Bard: (sings)"The warrior and the jester, quite an unusual pair. Chanced to meet a bard, with such flowery flair."
		- Bard: (sings)"Enchanted by his song, they took a brief respite. For it could be rather long, before they rested for the night..."
		- Jester: "That's a lovely voice you have. Are you formally trained?"
		- Bard: "No. I learned the lute from my father. Became a minstrel shortly thereafter."
		- Jester: "With such talent, I'm surprised I haven't heard of you before, mister...?"
		- Bard: "It's <name>"
		- Jester: "I'm Sigmund. It's a pleasure to meet you."
		- Aylmera: "And I'm Aylmera. Nice to meet you."
		- Bard: "Oh my. Aylmera? Like the brave warrior? Your parents had high expectations for you..."
		- Aylmera: "Yes... Something like that."
		- Bard: "What brings you two outside the castle walls, anyhow? Not many folks go the way you're heading."
		* The jester looks at Aylmera, who looks back at him. Then they turn to face the Bard.*
		[Just traveling.]
			Bard: "Mhmmm. Sure. That sounds airtight. Just 'traveling' from the castle deep into bandit controlled lands."
		[Quest for the King.]
			Jester: "Aylmera! Shh! You'll have to pardon her, <name>, it's just a joke between the two of us."
		- Jester: "What she meant to say was that we're outside the castle to-"
		- Bard: "Look. I'm not gonna grill you two on it. Your business is none of mine. And we all have our secrets."
		- Bard: "But be careful who you mention that King of yours to. He's become mighty unpopular as of late."
		- Aylmera: "We'll keep it in mind. Thanks."
		- Bard: (sings)"And so the pair bid their new friend adieu, off on a quest to meet with God knows who..."
		* Bard smiles.
	b. After fighting Vivian (Outside of the town w/a bridge, heading North ahead of you all)
		- He thanks the party for 'opening' the bridge. He also slyly insinuates that he knows they're responsible. But doesn't say why (he's working with, or a sympathizer for, the banditry)
		- Continues Northbound himself ahead of the player.
	c. After you've slain the leper colony, but before you've slain the Lord's army. (Inside the Lord's city)
		* Here he's encountered in the city. But isn't directly present for your slaughter of it.
			~ Though he's assumed to be IN the city when the fighting starts.
		* You mention to him that you came from the NW city (lepers). And that you're now seeking an audience with the Lord.
		* He also notes the new party member, Neera. And they're introduced to each other.
	d. Before entering the destroyed Ramparts into the Aether Ruins (he doesn't venture in)
		* Since he didn't go on the Swamp side route, he's been waiting at the ramparts a while before you.
		* He mentions a traveler came through (perhaps it's implied it was the Bloodhound?). Who detailed the slaughter of the Lepers.
		* As such, he puts together the pieces that the Bandits, Lepers, and the Lord's army + Monastery have all been destroyed as you've encountered them.
		* He asks you point blank about why you're killing so much. About what that leaves to even save.
		* Alexandros, having met him for the first time here, should be the most incensed. "Just who the hell is this guy?" type of vibe.
		* You tell him you intend to enter the Aether Ruins. Which he regards as suicide.
		- Bard: "Perhaps I'm the fool for thinking there's any solution other than violence." (retorting to the Jester)
	e. Before you return to the Castle (Just outside the city gates)
		- Bard: "A party of four, innocent no more. The treachery of these lands, mostly done by their hands."
				"Now they disbelieve, truth they must bereave. Such is the price, of a life ruled by vice."
		- Aylmera: "You don't know half of what you've seen, Bard."
		- Bard: "And yet I still see more than most. Go on in, killer. They're waiting for you."
		[Ignore him.]
			Bard: "The woman clad in red, all her acquaintances dead. Left alone to muse, she finally chose to defuse."
		[Kill him.]
			*After he dies.*
			Bard: "Who... will tell your story...?"
120. Separation from the party
	- Have a segment of the game where you fall into a river and are almost drowned by your heavy armor.
	- This will trigger a dream/void sequence.
	- It will also result in the player having a brief segment where they must explore and fight by themselves (without the abilities of party members).
	- Reasons party members don't jump in to help:
		Jester = Cowardice, he fears himself dying.
		Neera = "I can't swim. Besides... My foresight has only shown me dry on these shores. I couldn't have gone in after you."
		Alexandros = ??? (perhaps this event should occur before reaching him)
121. Conversation with the Void at the end
	- Void: "Welcome back to the fold, hero. You've surpassed all expectations to make it this far."
	- You: "Will they be alright...? Is the Realm saved?"
	- Void: "What follows never mattered. Only your relationship to it in the moment."
	- Void: "You fulfilled your duty. You passed the test. Take solace in those facts."
	- You: "Tell me what happens. I want to know."
	- Void: "Now you must put it behind you. Further contemplation will only bring you anguish."
	- You: "I DESERVE to know. Does the Realm survive?"
	- Void: "..."
	- Void: "No. It does not. But you already knew that."
	- You: "So it was all in vain? Why even send me on such a quest?!"
	- Void: "We did not revive you. That was humanity's doing..."
	- Void: "You should abandoned these notions, lest they become an unbearable penance."
122. The latter half of the game should have significantly more emotionally broken characters.
	- People who are insane or hostile.
	- Those who have come to terms with their agony, and choose killing or death.
123. What if there were letters you could uncover that detailed the Great War? And the Prince's journal of it.
	- Would be difficult to elegantly incorporate these notes into the world, though.
124. Conversation with the Bandit Queen (Vivian) at the end (Finale)
	* She sits atop the throne, flanked by some of her bandits.
	Vivian: "Ah! Welcome, warrior! I had high hopes you would return to me."
	Vivian: "Your significance was lost on me during our first encounter."
	Vivian: "But hearing of your handiwork across the realm has left me impressed!"
	Vivian: "The death left in your wake gave us the perfect opportunity to overthrow that despicable king."
	* She smiles, in a forced manner. *
	Vivian: "But I'm afraid that's where the pleasantries cease."
	Vivian: "You see, ever since my scouts reported you venturing deep into the Aether."
	Vivian: "I've had only one question on my mind:"
	Vivian: "What did you find that far East?"
	Aylmera: "I don't know... Misery."
	Vivian: *Confusion (?)*
	Vivian: "What do you mean?"
	* The jester cracks a smile. *
	Jester: "Nonsense, Aylmera! We found Fear by the bushel!"
	Alexandros: "And droves of Death!"
	Neera: "And so, *so* much Chaos! Hahaha!"
	* The party all burst out laughing. *
	* Vivian gets annoyed. *
	Vivian: "Have you all gone mad?!"
	Vivian: "Or do you wish to mock me?"
	Aylmera: "Oh brave Warrior..."
	Aylmera: "We could not mock you more greatly than you have yourself."
	Aylmera: "The moment you sat atop that ridiculous throne."
	Jester: "You've spent too long away from home."
	Neera: "Too long in the silence."
	Alexandros: "Too long as the enemy."
	Aylmera: "You've forgotten your purpose."
	Aylmera: "And now is the time for the world to forget you."
	Vivian: "Tch."
	Vivian: "You seek to challenge me?"
	Aylmera: "We don't have to. This castle will fall regardless."
	Vivian: "Whatever do you mean? My men are fortifying it as we speak."
	Vivian: "You've slain every other army in the region."
	Vivian: "I can finally usher in an era of abundance, and peace! The Realm can be allowed to flourish!"
	* Aylmera gets resolutely sad/somber *
	Aylmera: "No. It cannot."
	Vivian: "Why must you continue to stand in my way?"
	Vivian: "Can you not envision the future I wish to build for us?!"
	* Aylmera shouts, stepping forward. *
	Aylmera: "BECAUSE YOU SPEAK FOOLISHNESS!"
	* Aylmera starts coughing and is forced to kneel from it (cough, cough). *
	* Neera steps forward and turns toward Aylmera, comforting her. *
	Jester: "Your army is hardly large enough to man this structure."
	Jester: "The undead will breach these walls in a few months time."
	* Vivian is taken aback ?! *
	Vivian: "I thought your mission was to stave off the hordes."
	Vivian: "The King felt adamant of your success."
	Vivian: "There were reports of a bright blue light seen across the wasteland."
	Vivian: "And you returned from the Aether unscathed."
	Vivian: "How has that not managed to stop the threat?"
	* Aylmera, bloody mouthed and out of breath. *
	Aylmera: "Vivian... we stemmed their growth, but..."
	Neera: "But the undead are still out there."
	Jester: "Admit defeat, Bandit. There's no one left to defend you."
	Jester: "Whose soldiers would you call upon to protect this ruined castle?"
	Jester: "Like you said. Every last army is slain."
	Alexandros: "You've nowhere to possibly draw soldiers from against the remaining horde."
	Vivian: "What?! Nonsense! You all speak lies!"
	Vivian: "These foolish intimidation games won't work on me!"
	Aylmera: "...It's no trick, Vivian."
	Aylmera: "You thought yourself fit to rule, and now you carry the burden of the crown."
	*Aylmera smiles, standing up. *
	Aylmera: "So what say you, oh magnificent Queen of all that is to be Dust and Ash?"
	Aylmera: "What is your first royal decree?"
	*Vivian is furious*
	Vivian: "..."
	Vivian: "To purge my throne of heretics."
	* Vivian charges down the stairs, triggering combat/Engagement *
125. Historical lore about a famous fight
	- Two warriors are fighting one another, they are evenly matched opponents. Enemies for a long time.
	- They engage in an honorable fight, one on one, and intend to fight to the death to finish their dispute.
	- One of the warriors loses the upperhand and is about to be slain by his opponent.
		~ Yet, at the last moment his ally (whose presence was unbeknownst to either fighter) reveals themselves and throws a sword or shoots a projectile to save their friend.
		~ This kills the opponent, effectively reversing what WOULD have been the outcome.
	- The surviving warrior is both thankful and distraught. His win is not earned. His shame is overwhelming. And he feels hate and betrayal from his ally.
		~ Such is the burden of the victor. It is the dead who have the easiest job of all. 
126. "It's always the thieves who are most concerned with issues of theft."
127. Outline of the time Aylmera spends separate from the party.
	- After Aylmera almost drowns, she wakes up downriver in a village and has to head North-westish along the river to return to the road.
		~ It's here that Aylmera encounters the weeping knight, who sits along the floral banks.
		~ He's distraught by the bloodshed that happened there. But he's also overwhelmed by the beauty of it all, and that conflict eats at him.
	- Then you must travel East along the road in order to reach the Lord's city.
128. Discussion between Alexandros and a Critic of Magic
	* This person should call out Alexandros IN or close to the Lord's city, where wizards are actively hunted.
	* This critic calls him out, and openly talks about his ideology, but doesn't alert the guards. His comments are cruel, but his actions are oddly empathetic to Alexandros' struggle.

	Critic of Magic: "Hmm. You're a student of the Great Tower, aren't you?"
	Alexandros: "...You must have me mistaken with someone else."
	Com: "There's no need to be coy about it."
	Alexandros: "I'm not here to cause you trouble."
	CoM: *Smiles* "The fact that you think that *is* the trouble."
	Alexandros: *Confused(?)*
	CoM: "I've seen some of what your kind can do. Your magicks would certainly usher in a wave of progress for the Realm."
	CoM: "Yet, progress is often coupled with cruelty, isn't it? Cruelty imposed by the powerful to preserve their rule."
	Alexandros: "So you think I'm here to oppress you?"
	CoM: "Well, significant changes to life in the Realm would upset the current balance of power. Disturbing whatever organizations are in control."
	CoM: "One might argue the very introduction of change is... a violent one. No?"
	CoM: "So what do these organizations do when presented with such hostilities? They retaliate. With a greater amount of violence."
	CoM: "After all, humans are just packs of animals. And there's not an animal in the world that turns meek when cornered."
	Alexandros: "So you think 'my kind' is to blame for the atrocities that others commit? That's rich."
	CoM: "Of course not. But you need to recognize your role in this as a violent one, lest you worsen things for us all."
	CoM: "Treat your ideology as the violence it is, and you'll be prepared for the hostility it invites."
	CoM: "Fail to do so and well... it'll be weaponized against you."
	Alexandros: "That just sounds like an excuse to be another hateful, cruel oppressor."
	CoM: "Well, you saw what happened to your ideologically-pure brethren. They got cornered first. And their prize was a mass grave."
	Alexandros: "...That's a cruel thing to say to a man who watched all his friends die."
	CoM: "And now you see how the game is played. Just remember: You gamble with more than your own fate when you upset power."
	Alexandros: *Pauses* (...) "..."
	CoM: *The man waves you away dismissively.* *He walks away.*
	*Alexandros rejoins the party*
130. "I don't know what you think you're doing here, but it's not helping."
131. Conversation about Velazquez
	- "When the hordes first swarmed up North, most the smaller villages got swallowed up."
	- "Many killed in the dead of night, folks leaving their crops to wither on the vine."
	- "The only thing faster than the undead approach was the fear that ran rampant. Lot of uncertainty and anxiousness."
	- "But amidst all that anxiety and chaos a single group rose to the challenge: Principled knights who felt no fear."
	- "Velazquez's men. They came and conquered. Hard. Smote those corpses that come up here, and drove the rest back several dozen miles."
	- "So that's your answer to the question you ain't yet asked. That's why the people don't stand up to 'em."
	- "I've seen those knights take all manner of things from us working folk: food, coins, family. But it don't matter..."
	- "Without him and his men we wouldn't have any of it anyway. We'd be nothing more than fertilizer for them fields."
	- "Most folks rationalize it to themselves. Say the knights earned it. Like it's a debt of sorts."
	- "Guess the world has a cruel way of keeping balance, eh?"
	Aylmera: "It's mankind who's cruel. Not nature."
		- "Maybe. Still, they saved our hides. We'd be fools to forget that."
	- "Just try to stay outta their way. We got a good thing going here, even if you don't see it that way."
132. Rejoining Neera and Sigmund (the Jester)
	- Jester: "Aylmera!"
	- Jester: "*He hugs you tenderly*"
	- Jester: "I was worried you'd been washed away for good."
	- Neera: "He had trouble keeping faith in my visions of your return."
	- Jester: *Frowns*
	- Jester: "We tried searching for you, but his Lordship's soldiers were patroling the area..."
	- Jester: "I didn't want us to get discovered. Traveling warriors are met with suspicion around here."
	- Aylmera: "I understand. I'm glad we're reunited once again."
	- Aylmera: "We need to find Alexandros while there's still time."
	- Neera: "My visions are hazy, but we've heard rumors he's held in the Lord's dungeon. Beneath the keep."
	- Aylmera: "Then we'll need to find a way inside."
133. Insights from the past
	* Consider having a sage/seer like character that has dozens of strange quotes/questions that can be talked to in order to hear one at random.
	- "Fear is all they knew when writing the Old Texts. Freedom was all they felt when reading them." (they = the Royal wizards)
	- "This conflict pre-dates the King. It was started a century and a half ago, when the Elders first documented the forbidden techniques."
		~ This raises the natural counterpoint of, "Forbidden by whom?"
	- "When the Archangels first fell to the Earth and realized they could no longer fly, did they weep?"
		~ [Yes.]
			"How could they not?"
		~ [No.]
			"For they knew already of their great burden."
	- "It's a fool who thinks he can control the will of others."
	- "When the smoke clears, who will be left?"
	- "Trails of blood. Is such a thing the path to enlightenment?"
	- "Authority grants us the freedom to act, yet rarely the freedom to feel."
	- "Do you know what drove these lands to such madness?"
		[The Great Tower.]
			"That was merely the catalyst."
		[The King.]
			"He was merely a victim of his own selfish desires."
		"Twas bearing witness to inaction amidst a time of great chaos. Such a thing cannot be forgotten."
	- "The nobles say chivalry is dead. Where was it last buried?"
	- "The church sings sermons which itself disobeys. For whom are its teachings?"
	- "Long before the King, it was warring tribes who first ceased to salt each other's lands during war."
		"For what is the point of ruling ashes? Such was the forethought the past gave to the future."
	- "How many would you kill, in order to save those who remain?"
	- "From where do you draw the strength to push onward? Can you not see that all is lost?"
	- "The only blessed are they dead. For they know the peace of stillness."
134. The story of what happened immediately after the Great Explosion should be recounted differently by all characters. Have no consensus to its memory.
135. Neera and the Jester after slaying Morcant
	* This should probably occur after the party convinces him he can't stop to bury the corpse.
	- Jester (kneeling at the side of Morcant's body): "Priestess... Did you know of this? Did you receive visions of this moment?!"
	- Neera: "Yes. But to share everything I see would only bring about further misery."
	- Neera: "Truthfully, I've known of the Prince's state since we first met at the Leper Colony."
	- Neera: "But I also knew of your determination, Sigmund. I bore witness to over a hundred encounters with him, most ending in failure."
	- Neera: "And despite that, it was you who consistently fought the hardest. Fighting to the bitter end each and every time."
	- Neera: "It's how I know you have the strength to persevere."
	- Jester: *Cries* (or maybe just emote tears welling up in eyes?)
	- Alexandros: "So you've known of everything up until now?"
	- Neera: "No. I've never lied to you of what I know. And now, amidst these ruinous energies, my foresight is no better than yours."
	- Neera: "This was as far as I could see. We're all wandering blind now."
	- Jester: "Neera."
	- Jester: "At least say some words for him. Death rites, a funeral prayer, anything..."
	* Reference the Funeral prayer written previously. Combine these 2 interactions into one. What's here adds good depth to the interaction.
136. Neera explaining herself and her powers
	- Neera: "Make no mistake, I think myself not the messiah. I am but a vessel of the Lord, and I wish only to spread his word."
	- Neera: "Though a unique gift, my significance is no greater than the pages of a holy book. Albeit my methods are more direct."
	- Neera: "At first I found it a burden being forced to listen to the whims of another. But the more I heard, the more I understood."
	- Neera: "My resolve grew as I understood the central truth of it all: God needs us, just as we need him."
	- Neera: "Don't you see? Without a vessel, he speaks into a vaccuum. And without followers, he has no influence."
	- Neera: "Thusly, our relationship to the divine is one of symbiosis."
	- Neera: "We are paired to the divine as dark is to light, or as sun is to moon."
	- Neera: "My blessing is to be at the midpoint of that pairing. Truly beautiful, don't you agree?"
	[You're blessed.]
	[You're cursed.]
		~ Neera: "I admire your doubt, but I'm already certain of my role in this matter."
137. Confrontation with an adversary
	- Enemy: "Ha! Where were you to proselytize when I murdered for sport?"
	- Enemy: "You should be wary of scolding those who pose a threat. 'Never poke a sleeping bear'?"
	- Enemy: "Allow me to teach you such a valuable lesson!"
138. Mindset of the bandits
	- Aylmera: *Refers to the opposition as 'bandits'*
	- Bandit: "You call us 'bandits'. Yet I doubt you know what such a word even entails."
	- Bandit: "It stems from 'one who is banished'. Others tend to call us outlaws. You know, those 'outside the law'."
	- Bandit: "And yet... we are far from lawless. And we are far from banished."
	- Bandit: "Indeed the Crown has denounced us. But under what authority does he rule?"
	- Bandit: "He leads a broken kingdom lacking morals. Even the wizards saw that."
	- Bandit: "And now we hear rumors from up North. They say the priests no longer hear the voice of God."
	- Bandit: "See, I think even the almighty is having doubts about our leadership."
	- Aylmera: "Nonsense. You sound like little more than selfish opportunists."
	- Bandit: *Angrily frowns*
	- Bandit: "It's a shame you're so blinded by your loyalties. We're on the verge of making real progress here.'"
	- Bandit: "Nevertheless, you'll understand in due time. Our Queen will usher in an era of stability and abundance."
139. Aylmera's questions about her revivial
	- Aylmera: "Wizard. What do you know of the ritual that summoned me?!"
	- Aylmera: "My limbs ache! My body fails me as my eyes stream blood! And my memories have become scattered."
	- Aylmera: "I'm owed an explanation! Tell me what you know."
140. The Butcher
	- Player: "I heard your enemies call you a vile name: 'The Butcher'.
	- Butcher: "No. You've misheard. My enemies don't call me that. But my friends do."
		~ Alternately: "You heard wrong. It's my friends who call me that."
	- Butcher: "No... My enemies know me by many other names. Killer. Cannibal. Rapist."
	- Butcher: "Given the opportunity... I wonder which title you'll choose for me." *Smiles wickedly*
	* Engages the player, triggering battle *
141. Lone Ramparts Guard
	- Unknown: "Though many saw the explosion, most don't remember it well. Because of the sheer chaos that followed it. But I was here, watching intently from my post. Taking in every moment as it flashed before me."
	- Unknown: "I saw the frenzy fill everything it could touch. Bodies of all shapes and sizes, dead or alive, human or animal, it didn't matter. They all rose together under the sole banner of unbound chaos."
	- Unknown: "In truth... I envy them. They're the only ones at peace in the aftermath."
	- Player: "Certainly you don't consider the present situation an improvement for the Realm?"
	- Unknown: "Why shouldn't I? You and I are in no position to judge the will of nature, and no King has ever established such uniform peace. You know they never fight amongst themselves? They don't even feast on the dead. They simply hunt the living."
	- Player: "So you wish to join them? Take part in their uniform peace?"
	- Unknown: "No. I wish to observe them. Perhaps the truth of their world will reveal a path forward for us all."
	* You leave the man to his ravings. *
143. Dialogue with His Lordship 
	- Lord: "Have you ever felt certainty about your role in restoring so-called order to the Realm? What does that even mean to you? Is it about serving a single King, or serving the many inhabitants of the Realm?"
	- Lord: "My father spent his life serving a King, your King, and his reward was swift death on a suicide mission. The fate of his men was the same, the few survivors were either maimed or traumatized."
	- Lord: "I often wonder how much more he could've accomplished serving his people."
	- Lord: *Pauses* "Do you think there's such a thing as a 'justified' war?"
	[Absolutely.]
		~ Lord: "You would have liked my father. He'd have led you to a glorious death."
	[Absolutely not.]
		~ Lord: "Then perhaps you are not as much a fool as his King." (referring to the Jester)
144. First encounter with the Bloodhound (Hermit) (Old, needs to be reworked as just telling the story, no combat)
	(This occurs shortly after the player has slaughtered the Leper colony.)
	*Party passes a hermit sitting alone, in a tunnel by a campfire*
	Hermit: "You seem tired, please come sit by the fire and rest a moment."
	Player:
		[Accept.] (Rework this slightly, FORCE the player to Accept the invitation.)
			Hermit: "It's not oft that travelers venture this close to my seclusion. Truthfully, I miss their companionship."
			Alexandros: "Are you not here to be alone? To be isolated, with peace of mind?"
			Hermit: "...Yes, I am. Yet sometimes what we need isn't what we desire. Tell me. Which guides you more, your needs or your wants?"
			Player:
			[My Needs.]
				Hermit: "Practical and admirable. To deny one's desires is a true strength."
			[My Wants.]
				Hermit: "Understandable. What are we if not creatures guided by our comforts?"
			Hermit: "So then, do you know what lies ahead for you?"
			[Yes.]
				Hermit: "And yet you still choose to accompany me? I suppose it's easy to feel dead in such a lonely world. Perhaps I'm not the only one who desires compassion..."
			[No.]
				Hermit: *Smiles* "That's alright. I know well enough for the both of us."
			Hermit: "I want to tell you a story. When I was younger, I was known for my keen sense of smell. So much so, that I earned the nickname Bloodhound in my village."
			Hermit: "You see, I could pick up the stench of death on a traveler long before they reached our village. I protected us from lots of violence this way..."
			Hermit: "But one day, a young man approached. His body and eyes were tired, as though he'd been walking for days. And though, to me, he reeked, he was so timid and frail that no one thought him any threat."
			Hermit: "He told us his family had been slaughtered by bandits, their blood still staining his clothes, as he threw himself at our feet and begged for our assistance in seeking revenge."
			Hermit: "It must have been pity that led us to believe him, but we diligently formed a search party and followed him to his family's farmstead. And it wasn't until we were inside that we were ambushed by his creations."
			Hermit: "He was an unholy magician, a necromancer, and the entire property had undead buried beneath its soil. As we searched the house, they rose from the earth and surrounded us."
			Hermit: "By some miracle, we were able to escape. Though with our dead and injured, we were slow in our return home. Our prolonged abscence had left the village vulnerable to his minions, and he easily overran it. The bodies were all cold by the time we made it back."
			Hermit: "Truthfully, I've forgotten the faces of his victims. But that stench... that sickly, sweet aroma... It sticks with me in an unnatural way."
			Hermit: "I've carried that story inside me a long time..."
			*The Hermit pauses* (... emote)
			Hermit: "But nevermind all that. Us old-timers have plenty of time to reminisce on our past mistakes."
			Hermit: "I appreciate you for keeping me company."
	*As the player goes to leave (back-turned), the Hermit throws a knife at them and lunges, triggering combat.*
	[If Accept., Needs., and Yes.]
		Hermit: "I'm sorry. But I can't let myself risk another mistake..."
	[Elif Accept.]
		Hermit: "I know you can't possibly be him, yet... you bear his remarkable stench."
145. Vivian on the night of the Great Explosion
	- Vivian: "You can't imagine the death that I saw. That WE saw. As we followed that idiot King and his foolish son into a brutal war. And what was our grand prize?"
		"No victory. No medals. Not even a break from the bloodshed."
		"My arm still lies on that battlefield, along with the shattered bones of my brethren."
   		"Nothing you say will excuse those facts. The King's wishes brought us to the precipe of ruin."
		"So... if you truly serve him, then you must be stopped."
146. Jester's relationship with the King and comments on Morcant
	- Jester: "I've known the King a long time... I consider him my closest friend. But after his son was born, I saw a glimpse of something even better than he."
	"A brighter future for us all. That boy grew into a man more capable and noble than even his father. With intuition unrivaled, and a heart so pure."
	"The King could see it too. It filled him with immense pride. But that same pride is what led him astray."
	"He couldn't be dissuaded from war with the wizards. And his son, eager to please father, led the final charge. The one that felled the Tower."
	"I saw the destruction it wrought, not just on the Realm, but on the King himself. He tried to reassemble the crumbling pieces, but much like a broken mirror: the picture could no longer be made whole."
	"And now he lacks the resources, and prowess, to remedy this situation. I think he sometimes wishes the Prince were here in his stead."
	"The Aether robbed us of a deserving King. Of one who could remedy this whole mess."
		- The Jester coming to terms with how the King is unfit to rule.
147. High Priest toward Neera
	- High Priest: "You've proven unworthy of the gifts the Church has bestowed you."
	- High Priest: "I'll be sure you understand when I rip that eye from its socket."
	- Neera: *Laughs* "I've meditated on this moment before, and God has shown me ample visions..."
	- Neera: *Evil smile* "Of your death."
	* Combat starts*
148. Bard's Rhymes/Encounters
	* He should make reference here to the ancient ritual of Divine Penance and resurrection (which Aylmera is taking part in, unbeknownst to her)
	a. Bard: *Musical note* "Deep below, the spirits listen: hearing songs of old. 
			A chant, a tale, of those forgiven, should they do as told.
			A chance above with newfound vision, flesh enrobes their souls.
			Wander free, yet not too far, for penance pays the toll."
	   Aylmera: "You have a beautiful voice. Did you write that piece?"
	   Bard: "Thank you. And no. It's a traditional tune, from long ago. Though I'm glad you enjoyed it."
	   		 "Do you think you know what it's about?"
	   [Love.]
			Bard: "Maybe. It certainly sounds compassionate. Yet it'd be strange for them to mention penance then, no?"
	   [Pain.]
		   Bard: "Hmmm. It certainly sounds somber. But the tune is rather upbeat for such bleak subject matter."
		Bard: "I think it has to do with desiring change. Everyone's following a path. But what if they want something else? What if they forge anew?"
			  "I dunno. Sometimes I spend too long with the lyrics in my mind, they poison my thoughts. I'm just the performer. I didn't write the damn thing."
149. Reflections from a stranger
	"When you die, and your soul awakens in whatever follows this life: What will you think of all the possessions you once held dear?"
150. Reflections on the Lost City
	- Leper: "This place used to be rather impressive before it was the rubble you see before you."
	- Leper: "The stories from the old timers are, frankly, unbelievable."
	- Leper: "They say aqueducts brought fresh water to the door of each home."
	- Leper: "That some of the buildings rose as high as 10 stories!"
	- Leper: "Consensus is it was the most peaceful city in the Realm. A place where both freedom and creativity could thrive."
	- Aylmera: "So what happened to it?"
	- Leper: "Same as the Great Tower. Wizards lit the place on fire. Burned it to little more than ash."
	- Leper: "Not all at once, mind you. Took them about a fortnight to kill and rout every soldier. But they did it."
	- Aylmera: "Why in the heavens would they do that?"
	- Leper: "Beats me. Some say it was a vendetta. Others say it was a blood sacrifice for some large ritual..."
	- Leper: *Laughs*
	- Leper: "One story even says it was a lover's quarrel! Wouldn't that be a helluva thing?"
	- Leper: "But, you know how people talk. Can't take anything they say at face value."
	- Leper: "Don't matter much now anyhow. The only visitors here are those left with nowhere else to go."
151. Confronting Alexandros for his loyalties to the Mad Wizard
	- Aylmera: "Alexandros. We need to talk about the Mad Wizard."
	- Aylmera: "Why did you follow a man with such a destructive past?"
	- Aylmera: "Rumor is he destroyed the Lost City in a fortnight. Reduced it to ashes."
	- Alexandros: "Indeed. I've heard the same stories. They happened long before I was born, but I don't doubt their accuracy."
	- Alexandros: "But you're wrong about leaving ash in his wake. That isn't-"
	- Alexandros: *Pauses*
	- Alexandros: "...wasn't his way. And it definitely isn't what he left behind there."
	- Alexandros: "I went and visited the wreckage myself some years ago. Few structures were left standing, but it was overflowing with flora."
	- Alexandros: "You saw it yourself. Unusual for explosions and fire to leave behind such a rich ecosystem, no?"
	- Alexandros: "It's unnatural. And has grown lush at a rate faster than you would expect, given the timeframe from its destruction."
	- Alexandros: "You see, when he and his wizards stormed the city after everyone had fled, they cast spells to heal the earth."
	- Alexandros: "Accelerated the growth of plants, and ensured the waters flowed clear."
	- Jester *Questioningly*
	- Jester: "But it was a beacon of civilization. A city where peace prospered! What reason was there to destroy such a thing in the first place?!"
	- Alexandros: "I can't speak for his motive, but I can speak on peace. It's rarely ever earned through goodwill. Just look at His Lordship's keep."
	- Alexandros: "The safest town for miles, and yet?"
	- Alexandros: "Cruel beyond measure."
	- Alexandros: "I'd imagine the Lost City had something equally distasteful about its origins."
	- Jester: "That's ridiculous. You're just validating his actions after the fact."
	- Jester: "Neera. Can't you use your foresight to determine the truth about what happened?"
	- Neera: "Not at all. My visions go forward in time, not backward."
	- Neera: "But Alexandros seems sincere. You know he's not the type to lie."
	- Jester: "*Sigh* What do you make of all this, Aylmera? Do you think the Mad Wizard had good reason to destroy the Lost City?"
	[Yes.]
		- Jester: "I hope you're right, but..."
		- Jester: "I just don't know."
	[No.]
		- Alexandros: "It's foolish to fear what you don't know. "
		- Alexandros: "It only holds you back from the truth."
	- Neera: "I'd like you all to remember our mutual dependence in this journey. None of us makes it alone."
	- Neera: "We can't allow the shadows of the past to stymie our forward progress. Therefore..."
	- Neera: "It's time we carried on."
152. Concepts discussed with His Lordship/High Priest
	- His Lordship: "You share the short-sight of your beloved King. A failure to recognize our progress."
	- Aylmera: "Slavery and torture aren't improvements. Your lands are regressing."
	- His Lordship: "How blind. You're unable to see the stability I've carved amidst the chaos."
	- His Lordship: "I've established rules for my people. They abide by them and are rewarded for their obedience."
	- Jester: "Rewarded... You speak of them as though they were dogs."
	- Neera: "Even the scripture decries your actions. You violate many of the sacred tenets."
	- High Priest: "The scripture is merely a translation of God's will."
	- High Priest: "It's important we re-evaluate our principles to match the challenges he provides us."
	- Neera: "Speak not to me as though I were a peasant! You know I hear his divine will more clearly than any other!"
	- High Priest: "Heretic. Your audacity betrays your madness. The divine would never let a woman bear his message."
	- High Priest: "The monastery graciously exiled you from our ranks. I see now that was a mistake."
	- High Priest: "We should have killed you."
153. Vivian reveals that the Prince was not as noble as we were initially led to believe.
	- Though admirable and fearless in battle, he forced many of his men to rush the Great Tower (recklessly) with threat of death to deserters.
	- As a result, many of the soldiers blame him and his foolishness for the Realm's inability to have an army leftover to fight the undead.
	- Therefore, many have sided with the Vivian and wish for a rebellion.
154. Laments of a simple farmer
	- Farmer: "This village has been on the verge of famine for a few years now."
	- Farmer: "We've barely enough grain to survive the cold season. And any excess we produce gets shipped away."
	- Farmer: "First it was by the Royal soldiers, insisting we donate our grain to 'assist the war effort'."
	- Farmer: "That lasted a few years. But feeding such a massive army starved our soil of sustenance."
	- Farmer: "Then, after the war failed, the army retreated into their castle, rarely venturing outside."
	- Farmer: "Guess we owe the undead for a few months of relative peace."
	- Farmer: *Nods in thought*
	- Farmer: "But once it was time to harvest, remnants of that same army descended on the fields. 
	- Farmer: *Chuckles to himself, sadly*
	- Farmer: "Now raiding us under a brand new banner: banditry."
	- Farmer: "This time, they tell us it's in the name of 'revolution'. Nothing revolutionary about theft."
	- Farmer: "Damn fools can't even see the land is ruined. The crops grow shriveled and bitter."
	- Farmer: "Most the folks 'round here won't make it past winter..."
	- Farmer: "And the bandits won't make it much longer after that."
	- Farmer: "Maybe we should salt the earth. Perhaps then they'd understand their predicament..."
155. Rhymes from the Bard
	- Note: This feels more Hip Hop style in the line construction, which might not be fitting for the Bard's demeanor.
	Bard: "She put the Realm in a vice, bet she never thought twice,"
		"Shanked her way to the top, she ain't here to play nice."
	Bard: "Heard tales of the horrors, bestowed by her blade,"
		"They pale in comparision to the terrors erased."
	Bard: "Stranger to the people, she was born from zero,"
		"Danger to the feeble, her scorn unlike a hero."
156. Notes on the Fishing Village
	- Add details from surrounding and previous areas about rumors in the fishing village.
	- Have one core rumor be that it's an evacuation point from the mainland.
		~ People are boarding boats casting off to islands in the surrounding area.
	- Have there some truth to these claims, but by the time you arrive all the boats have left.
	- Hence the mass suicide by those forced to remain.
157. Historical quote about esteemed warrior/general who avoided disadvantaged battles
	- In retort to critics of his unwillingness to initially fight:
	"I fear not the opinions of my enemies. Let them call me a coward today. For it shall worsen the sting they feel when I defeat them tomorrow."
158. Literature Checks
	- Have certain characters or dialogue scenarios where the player is asked "Have you read X book?"
		~ Then prompt them with "Yes" or "No", and then actually check whether they've read it to give an answer.
		~ E.g. "You needn't lie to me, child." if they haven't and attempt to say they have.
		~ Perhaps even perform the check prior to showing the dialogues in order to show "Yes (Lie)", etc.
159. Jester's distress after seeing the King die and the castle fall
	Jester: "Alexandros. Aylmera. Neera."
	Jester: "I owe you each an apology."
	Alexandros: *Questioningly (?)* "What ever do you mean, Sigmund?"
	Jester: "Having seen the body of the King: I recognized something."
	Jester: "In death, he wore a peaceful smile upon his face."
	Jester: "An expression I hadn't seen him wear in many years."
	Jester: "Since before the attempts on his life."
	Jester: "Indeed, in the years after, he wore a mask of his disposition upon his face."
	Jester: "A mask, like those of comedy and tragedy, and yet I was too blind to see it."
	Jester: "Too driven by my prior loyalties. Too fearful of being a fool."
	Jester: "Now I understand. His face smiled falsely, while his eyes burned with flames of hatred."
	Jester: "In his conquest of the Wizards, he only ever sought revenge."
	Alexandros: *Questioningly (?)* "You're too hard on yourself, Jester. Your hindsight has burdened you."
	Jester: "No. I shouldn't have permitted him to send us on this quest."
	Jester: "Nor should I have allowed him to wage that damned war in the first place."
	Jester: "It's been a mistake all along."
	Neera: *Smiles* "Indeed it may appear so. And yet..."
	Neera: "Many things are kept from mortal sensibilities."
	Neera: "You know, I once compelled the Lord to share with me my own destiny."
	Neera: "At first he ignored my request. So I locked myself in my chambers and sat silently in protest."
	Neera: "Fasting and meditating for days on end, I ignored his ramblings, instead repeating my query in the form of chant."
	Neera: "When I had finally grown delirious, he spoke to me in the dead of night."
	Neera: "The cacophany of his voices quieted all at once, and a single mouth spoke softly in my ear:"
	Neera: "'Sweet daughter. To spoil thy fate would rob you of all its lessons."
	Neera: "Were it not valuable, I shan't have sent you to fulfill it.'"
	Neera: *Smiles warmly* "Your role in the play of life was not to halt our quest, dear Jester, but indeed to spur it."
	Jester: *Nods/Thumbs Up* "Then we should finish what we've started. The Realm depends on us."
160. Consider adding an encounter or world-lore about Drunken wolf attacks
	- Just like in real life, this would be a result of farmer's leaving fruits (e.g. grapes) on the vine, them starting to rot/ferment, and wild wolves eating them.
	- The result would be an enemy type, AND that some locals are fearful of being attacked. Or even barricading themselves in their homes.
161. Nobles, their influence, and their opinions.
	- Nobles should be encountered throughout the lands.
	- They are concerned with bottom lines: Stability, money, and luxury.
	- But they're also individuals, who are always considering their loyalties.
162. Leper Noble
	- LN: "Traveler. Could you spare a coin?"
	- Aylmera: "Sorry. I've nothing on me."
	- LN: "Ah. Then we've more in common than I thought."
	- LN: *Warm smile*
	- LN: "You know, I wasn't always the beggar you see before you."
	- LN: "Prior to my own family exiling me from my home, I was quite wealthy."
	- LN: "For many decades I ran some of the most successful vineyards in the realm."
	- Aylmera: "They exiled you just for being a leper?"
	- LN: *Laughs* "Hahaha. No, of course not. Well... maybe it played a role."
	- LN: "It certainly gave them a great excuse. But they'd wanted to oust me for years."
	- LN: "At least they had the honor not to slash my throat."
	- LN: *Pauses (...)*
	- LN: "Though I would've appreciated some more coin in my pocket before I left."
	- Aylmera: "So why did they oust you, then?"
	- LN: "Same reasons anyone does. Money and power. Plus the extent of my lands."
	- LN: "You see, my sister married a conniving knight. A real snake of a man."
	- LN: "As her brother, I thought her loyalties would lay with me when our father died."
	- LN: "But alas, she'd foolishly succumbed to her husband's charm."
	- LN: "And made plans to depose me."
	- LN: "Thus, when I fell ill, they were quick to banish me."
	- LN: "Bastards didn't even let me take some books with me."
	- Aylmera: "That's awful. I wouldn't know what to think of my family were I in your place."
	- LN: "Indeed. I've had many years to think all manner of ways about it."
	- LN: "Were my body not so destroyed, I might seek out revenge."
	- LN: *Has an idea (Lightbulb!)*
	- LN: "Actually, perhaps you could assist me with that..."
	- LN: "Should you find yourself in the Calloway manor, steal my copy of 'The Centennial King'."
	- LN: "Out of my entire library, that was my most prized possession."
	- LN: "Keep it, burn it, pawn it. It doesn't matter."
	- LN: "As long as it's kept from my sister's undeserving hands."
	[Absolutely.]
		- LN: "Thanks, stranger. My name's Eustace, by the way."
		- Aylmera: "I'm Aylmera." *smiles*
		- LN: "Well, Aylmera, it has been a pleasure speaking with you."
	[Absolutely not.]
		- LN: "Oh... I guess it was a long shot anyhow."
		- LN: "Regardless, it has been a pleasure speaking with you."
	- LN: "I hope you find whatever it is you're looking for all the way out here."
163. Conversations with psychos
	- These should be for Aether-scarred people. How/Where should the player encounter these groups? Most in the Aether Ruins should be a wasteland.
	- What if there was ONE guy who could be talked to with an INSANE amount of dialogue, and whenever the player decides to stop talking, combat will follow.
		~ All these lines could be repurposed for that person.
		~ A randomizer on their dialogue would be fantastic. Just pull a random, different thought from them on conversing.
			~ Try to avoid having repetition, with some final line if the player TRULY exhausts them all.
		~ Could even have party members come out and comment to you about what a "lost cause" this guy is after you've conversed a long time.
		~ He should be lucid, but totally lost in his own thoughts. A person who's views are almost impossible to parse or understand.
	aa. "How Death can Chaos unite?"
		[Excuse me?]
		[Huh?]
		"Eh. You wouldn't get it."
	ab. "Our arrows rained hell upon our enemies. Now it is God who rains hell upon us."
	ac. *Humming musically* "To kill, to maim, to be regarded: such is not the way."
		"The thrill, to hunt, shall be rewarded: pain dispersed away."
	ad. "I glimpsed the angels before they could witness me. Yet they were too quick to catch. So now I stroll among their spurned kin."
	ae. "I used to despise the Godless. Refused most my enemies a proper burial. Now I see the irony. I was Godless all along. He has abandoned these lands."
	af. "I was there at the beginning. Witnessed the blades that changed it all. Soft silver, stained with a thin layer of royal crimson. If only I'd been a painter..."
		~ This is referencing witnessing the assassination attempt on the King, and how the Queen was stabbed ("royal crimson").
	ag. "The night skies are so peaceful here. Such a stark contrast to the beautiful blue chaos of the Aether."
	ah. "How far is too far to travel? How long is too long away from home? Feels like I've spent a lifetime here now. Far longer than I've lived anywhere else."
	ai. "Did you hear the music of the night? Thousands wailing and groaning in unison. The undead chorus."
	aj. "Want to know the secret to survival? Forget that you ever existed. Truly. Once you forget, so too does the entire world."
	ak. "They used to hunt me, you know. Not sure what changed. Other than everything."
	al. "Met an old colleague out there. I think they recognized me. Hard to be sure."
	am. "10,000 years of aether and ash. Could you even imagine such a long time?"
	an. "Didn't think I'd ever see the Jester return. Most wouldn't have the stomach for it."
	ao. "Royal wizardry, huh? What's old is new. And the new, once again, relegated to being old."
		~ Referencing how there were Royal wizards before and after the Great War (though not during, hence the civil war).
	ap. "I can't sleep more than an hour a day anymore. I think it's the Aether. It keeps me awake through the night."
	aq. "The Aether speaks to me. Much like the rain or the wind. It has chosen me for its own purposes."
	ar. "I used to kill them, just like you. Thought I was helping. Now... I don't know. The Aether keeps me indifferent."
	as. "The dead don't bother me here. I could leave whenever I want."
		"But something here is calling to me."
		"And there's a second voice, too."
		~ A reference to the presence of the Spirit of Aylmera being present in the Aether Ruins.
	at. "Why did we do all this? Have we not achieved less than if we'd left it all alone? Gah."
	au. "I used to read a lot. Now I just think. Got plenty of time for it, too. Plenty."
	av. "There's more dead here than there used to be. I know that for a fact. They're stronger now, and so too is it."
	aw. "Sorry for not introducing myself. Truth be told, I can't recall my own name anymore. Ha!"
	ax. "I remember the faces of those I served with. But names? Not so much."
	ay. "Can't remember the last time I ate. Haven't felt hungry in a while. Oh well, more time to think."
	az. "Thanks for chatting with me. Been a while since I've met such a good conversationalist!" * He immediately laughs at his own joke. (as these are all one-sided converations) *
	--------- (Implemented up to this point, continue below) ----------
	ba. "Wonder what my father would make of all this. What was his name again...?"
	bb. "Have you been here long? Ah, probably not. It was a dumb question..."
	bc. "Sometimes I go for walks around the ashes. It really puts my mind in touch with things around here."
	bd. "The veteran soldiers told us it would be tough out here. How right there were!"
	be. "When I dream, I can hear the buzz of the Aether. It's often so loud that it wakes me right up."
	bf. "Started a new habit of daydreaming a lot more. Really helps me understand the plan out here."
	bg. "Blue fire, blue fire, blue fire. And yet it's not hot."
	bh. "Some of the wildlife startled me the other day. But they had Aether-filled eyes, so they didn't bother me none."
	bi. "Do you think we'll remember what Death remembers of us?"
	bj. "I wandered the pale earth until my legs could no longer bear my weight."
		"Was it my own weakness that gave way? Or my guilt?"
	bk. "Used to know why I decided to stay. Can't recall anymore. Must not have been important."
	bl. "Do you know what season it is? The days all run into one another here. I've lost track of time."
	bm. "I met God once. He laughed at me."
	bn. "If you could witness what my eyes have seen, you too would forget your past."
	bo. "You have an aura of whispers about you. They speak when they think no one is watching."
	bp. "Why are you still here? Have you nowhere to call home?"
	bq. "Strange to encounter a nomad these days. Most are trying to find a place to call home."
	br. "Would you believe your own eyes if they showed you the impossible? Or would you dismiss it with some excuse?"
	bs. "I spent a lifetime being apart. Now I'm a part of something bigger."
	bt. "I don't understand it. Not fully. But I don't have to."
	bu. "I've changed a lot since coming here. There's still more to come."
	bv. "Were you called here? Or did you come by choice?"
	bw. "Shame you brought such a posse. I'd show you truths, but not with *them* watching me."
		- At first glance this is about the player's party, but in reality it's his ability to "see" the entities in the afterlife.
	bx. "I was told there'd be others. Not like you, though."
	by. "Strange. I expected the people from the East to come through first. The kingdom is full of surprises."
	bz. "I'm happy to chat, but I can't help you any more than that. Got my own thing going on."
	ca. "Do you listen to much music? I used to have a couple favorite tunes. Wish I remembered how they went..."
	cb. "Death, death, death. You think it'll ever end?"
	cc. "The unknown of my fate used to bother me. Not anymore."
	cd. "You're a dangerous sort. Have you considered what that really means?"
	ce. "The death of the world didn't stop any of them, did it? They just went right back to scheming..."
	cf. "Do you know what you'll say when you get there? Ahahaha! Of course you don't!"
	cg. "Crestfallen wretches. The whole lot of them."
	ch. "Do you think more could've been spared if they just stayed? Sometimes I don't fully trust what I hear..."
	ci. "Anguish. That's killed more men than any war ever has. Still today it claims lives."
	cj. "I dreamt I drowned in a sea of fire. And when I woke, all I could taste was ash."
	ck. "To rest in this place is to feel intense unease and dread. I often startle awake, certain I've heard the dead screaming."
	cl. "Daydreaming used to bring me such peace. But now I can lose hours at a time staring blankly at nothing at all."
	cm. "The earth here speaks if you listen long enough. Hard to know what it says, but sometimes I can *feel* their intentions."
	cn. "Cut my thumb the other day. Thought it would bleed for sure. But it just... didn't."
	co. "I could feel you coming this way. Though I thought you were at least a half dozen strong. Guess my count was off..."
	cp. "Seems more and more my hairs stand on end."
	cq. "At night you can still see flickers of those early flames. A vibrant blue fire that burns cold like ice."
	cr. "Did you think they'd treat you differently out here? Because you're undead like them? I sure wouldn't count on it."
		Player: *?!* "How could you know that about me?"
		"Huh? Doesn't everyone?"
	cs. "Oh! Be careful not to..."
		"I don't remember what I was going to say. Forget it."
	ct. "You've seen the two sides all along, huh? Of course you have. But your friends don't know that, do they? Heheheh."
		- At a surface level this is about allegiances in the realm (Us vs. Them ideals), but it's about being on both sides of Life and Death.
	cu. "Do you think you could kill me? Not that I want you to, I just mean *could* you? Eh. Forget I even mentioned it."
	cv. "The smell out here is so... strange. A mix of frozen dirt and ash."
	cw. "You made it further than anyone else I've seen. Not the furthest East, though."
	cx. "I tried to leave a couple times. Always seemed to wind up right back here. So I settled down."
	cy. "A great big ball of flame. Who would do such a thing?"
	cz. "Think of all who died in order for us to be here now. Strangers amidst smoldering ash."
		"What a marvel it is to behold!"
	da. "How happy are those whose walls already burn!"
		- A play on "How happy are those whose walls already rise."
	db. "The homestead is on fire. Are you?"
	dc. "Passions burn while men bleed, yet both find themselves suffocated in ash."
	dd. "Was this what was meant to happen from the first dagger plunged? Or did we choose this path?"
	de. "I wonder why you're here. You probably wonder about me."
		"Let's agree not to talk about it."
	df. "They say the hair and fingernails of the dead continue to grow after death. Not here, though."
		- The dead are not continuing to age, the Aether seems to freeze them in time.
164. "Your ears are drowned out by the screams of the dead. You see only red."
	- Text before a key encounter in a cursed zone. Swap the palette to be entirely shades of red for the fight.
	- Follows the vibe of the sampled screams at 1:10 in this track:
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2gBcWdt7lo
165. Encounter at a gravesite
	NPC: "Are you here to pay your respects?"
	[Yes.]
		NPC: "Then kneel and pray."
	[No.]
		NPC: "Kneel and pray."
	[*Kneel*]
		NPC: "How did you know them?"
		Player: "I didn't."
	[Refuse.]
	NPC: "How dare you mock me!"
	*Combat starts*
166. Speaking to "traditional" angels in the Void
	(Encountering two biblically accurate angels that are conversing, and talking to one of them.)
	- Angel: "Who are you, strange one?"
	- Angel 2: "And why do you still have your form?" (the player's sprite is still Aylmera)
	- Angel: "Indeed. It must not be fully with us. Trapped somewhere up above."
		"How pitiful. It wishes to descend deeper but can't."
	- Angel 2: "Funny creature. Let me offer you advice:"
		"If faceless upon rising, remember to search first for yourself."
		"Lest you succumb to pitfalls set by the oldest ones."
	- Angel: "Pfft. Let her fret in futility. She can't fathom what you speak."
	- Angel 2: "Perhaps. Time will determine our truth."
167. Comments from survivors of the Great Explosion
	* This comments from a small contingent of ex-soldiers who have stayed at the edge of the ramparts keeping the undead at bay.
		~ They're here of their own accord, and serve no master, ideology, or ruler. Instead, they focus on doing the right thing to protect the realm. Though their numbers dwindle.
	- Stopped by a concerned soldier near the Aether border
		Ex-Soldier 1: "Oi! You're going *in* to the Aether, why?"
		"It's nothing but a mass grave. A violent, roaming mass grave."
		[King's business.]
		[Mind your business.]
		Ex-Soldier 1: "Whatever. You're fucking nuts to even try it."
			"Don't expect *my* ass to dig you a grave."
	- Asking a soldier about their experience at the Great Explosion
	[Tell me about the explosion.]
	Ex-Soldier 2: "What a foolish endeavor. You wish to dig up my memories like a dog sniffing at a fresh grave."
	"But so be it."
	"Chaos, agony, and fear ruled my every nerve that night. I swung sword and fired arrow until my body was numb with pain. Yet I persisted through it."
	"I carved metal from flesh, and flesh from bone until I was caked in blood."
	"When I finally emerged victorious, a few of my men signaled me for help."
	"They were utterly outmatched."
	"One had managed to crawl to me, and clung to my leg, his eyes full of terror."
	"I couldn't hear his voice, but I knew exactly what word he spoke to me."
	"He screamed my name. And I shot him in the face."
	*Sighs/Pauses*
	[Dear God...]
	[Oh.]
	"When I think about that man, I often wonder whether I killed him out of fear... or mercy."
	"Somehow, I think it was neither."
	*Pause (...)*
	"I'd like you to leave now."
	- Asking about why they don't leave.
	[Why not leave this place?]
		Ex-soldier 3: "And go where exactly? If we walk away, the whole Realm falls."
	[Did the King send you?]
		*Laughs*
		Ex-soldier 3: "Ahahaha! Hell no!"
		"His men don't have the stomach for this place."
		"They're happy to make war, but not to clean up their messes."
		"We have no leader. But we do have a mission."
		"To hold the wall. For as long as we can."
	[Sounds foolish.]
		Ex-soldier 3: "It's hardly more foolish than anything West of here."
		"You should consider doing Good, instead of just doing well."
	[Sounds admirable.]
		Ex-soldier 3: "I don't do it for your admiration. None of us do."
		"We do it because we understand the stakes."
		"If you really want to show thanks, learn to see things our way."
168. Doubt of the Elders
	NPC: "The doubt of the elders grows with each day."
169. Mad Wizard's Philosophy
	- The grand city to the northwest was razed by his own hand.
	- Because he knew what beauty would sprout in its place.
	- He didn't just believe in this cause... he was certain of it.
	- And how right he was to let it blossom.
170. Someone has written "Kill the Masters" across the wall, in dark, thick letters.
	- Do you think they knew what they meant by this?
	[Yes.]
		Then so do you.
	[No.]
		It's likely you don't either.
171. A man recalls his experience bleeding out in the Aether wasteland and almost dying.
	- If you're heading East, you should know I almost died out there.
	- Traded blows with one of those monsters while I was scouting. Had a mean gash in my abdomen.
	- For a long time I lie on the ground, my eyes closed, as the warmth of my blood spilled across my body.
	- I was half asleep. And half dead.
	- Waiting for another monster to come finish me.
	- Or for my blood to finally run dry...
	- Yet neither came.
	- It was in these ambiguous moments where I finally witnessed what I hadn't seen before.
	- My mind staring into the great beyond, I watched as solid darkness ate away at endless nothingness.
	- And I began to understand.
	- Even the great darkness was the presence of something. Whereas the nothingness could only be consumed.
	- Thus, to wallow in the nothingness was the only true path to darkness.
	- And it was the moment I understood this, when I woke up.
	Aylmera: "Why are you telling me this?"
	- Because fighting into the wasteland requires we purge it of darkness.
	- Which leaves behind nothing.
	- You must be certain to replace that darkness with something. Anything.
	- Lest the darkness creeps back in to fill the void you left behind.
	* The man nods at you politely. He has nothing more to say. *
	[Of course.]
	[*Say nothing.*]
172. Conversation with a man on the edge of the Aether
	Aylmera: "Excuse me, sir? I've been wondering something."
	Man: "Oh yeah?"
	Aylmera: "Why do you stationed here? Why not retreat further from the aether? Certainly it's safer to the West?"
	Man: "Retreat. Yeah! That's a good idea!"
	*The man laughs.*
	Man: "I don't retreat. Because the poor folks out East can't retreat either. Not once the aether gets hold of them."
	Man: "Lost my best friend, Miguel, the first few weeks. Saw him reanimate in front of my eyes."
	*The man pauses (...)*
	Man: "I felled him. But his body was too heavy for me to carry out alone."
	Man: "So I stationed myself here. Recruited some help. Then carried him out a while after."
	Man: "That was a couple years back. We buried him up on the hill, along with the others."
	Man: "He rests easy now."
	*Aylmera is questioning (?)*
	Aylmera: "I'm afraid I don't understand. If you got your friend out years ago, isn't that less of a reason to stay now?"
	Man: "Well, you see, I lost one friend in that hellhole, but gained a whole lot more because of it."
	Man: "They're swell guys 'round here. The type to trust with both your coinpurse and your life."
	Man: "'Course for a while I did plead with them. Begged 'em to leave it behind."
	Man: "But they all have their own reasons for staying..."
	Man: "And I can't bear the idea of them sharing the same fate as my buddy!"
	Man: "So I stay. I stay to serve my friends. "
	Man: "Until we get all our guys out from out East."
	Man: "Say, do you know who you serve?"
	[Myself.]
		Man: "Haha. That's what I thought too, hon!"
		Man: "But it couldn't be further from the truth."
		Man: "Take my word for it. You don't even want the solo path."
		Man: "It's a hollow existence."
	[I don't know.]
		Man: "Yeah. I remember when I felt that way."
		Man: "You want some advice?"
		[Yes.]
			Man: "Find something bigger than yourself. Let it inspire you."
			Man: "And soon enough, you'll inspire it."
		[No.]
			Man: "Suit yourself. It's no sweat off my back."
	Man: "Anyhow. I've been yapping too much."
	Man: "If you're all truly headed East, do yourselves a favor."
	Man: "Ensure you *all* make it back in one piece."
	Man: "You won't forgive yourselves otherwise."
	*The man nods at you, purposefully.*
	[Nod back.]
	[Smile politely.]
173. The fortification of soldiers bordering the Aether has a graveyard on the hill where they're buried their dead.
	- Many of them stay, because they want to kill and bury their reanimated friends. They want them to find peace.
174. Conversation with a wizard at the camp at the edge of the Aether
	- The team is surprised (especially Alexandros), that the wizard is welcomed among the soldiers at the camp.
	- But the wizard gets along with them, and shares a common purpose with them. She's also working to stop and bury the dead.
	- She describes how they're all unified, and dedicated to burying the dead (regardless of their side in the conflict).
	- Unexpectedly, at the edge of chaos is the only place that peace has truly blossomed.
	- Perhaps she (and all small NPCs) should have a name(s). Maybe Cassandra for her?
	Alexandros: "I simply must ask: How is it possible that these soldiers let you join their ranks?"
	Alexandros: "Why didn't they attack you when they saw the sigil on your robes?"
	Wizard: "I don't know. I guess they just took pity on a gal like me."
	*She smiles, politely.*
	*Alexandros frowns*
	Alexandros: "Come now, Miss... We both know that's preposterous."
	Alexandros: "Look at my robes. I was there that night. Same as you. I witnessed the barbary firsthand."
	*Alexandros lowers his voice*
	Alexandros: "...how they slaughtered our kin. Even after the explosion had ended the battle."
	*Her eyes narrow*
	Wizard: "Oh. Oh..."
	Wizard: "Then you already know. What's there to even say?"
	Wizard: "Those first few nights were so brutal."
	Wizard: "But you were there, you understand the chaos."
	Wizard: "It probably sounds odd, but I never blamed them for killing us in the aftermath."
	Wizard: "There was so much anger in that war."
	Wizard: "Besides, I fought tooth and nail to stay alive, too, y'know?"
	Wizard: "Killing undead and man alike. They all burned the same."
	Wizard: "It made no difference in that wretched darkness."
	Wizard: "Even now, my memories are mostly flashes of fire from my fingertips and the smell of scorched flesh."
	Wizard: "Only the stars bore witness to the atrocities we committed."
	Alexandros: "I don't understand. What changed your mind? Why did you stop fighting?"
	Wizard: "Well, because I fought long past my limits."
	Wizard: "Days of spell casting left my body fatigued. I had emaciated my mind to where I could no longer focus."
	Wizard: "After a while, I found myself just wandering through the darkness."
	Wizard: "Aimless. And slowly freezing to death in the harsh winds."
	* She glances into the distance for a moment, her eyes locked in place. *
	Wizard: "Even now... I can *feel* how cold I was. As though my soul itself was frigid."
	Wizard: "All I could think was 'I need to warm myself by a fire.'"
	Wizard: "And then, as though a miracle, I spotted some soldiers camping in the distance."
	Wizard: "With a roaring fire between them."
	Wizard: "So I resolved myself to sit beside it."
	Alexandros: "You weren't concerned for your safety?"
	Wizard: "It sounds outlandish, but no. With my mind so battered, all I could think of was that fire."
	Alexandros: "And then?"
	Wizard: "As I approached, a few of the men rose to their feet, unsheathing their blades."
	Wizard: "I just stumbled forward. Collapsing to my knees in front of their fire."
	Wizard: "My eyes fixated on those red hot coals."
	* She pauses (...) *
	Wizard: "I admit in that moment I prayed for one final comfort."
	Wizard: "I asked God for the soldiers to grant me a quick death."
	Wizard: "And as though to grant my wish, one of the men came up behind me."
	Wizard: "Then he..."
	* Her eyes well up with tears *
	Wizard: "He took the cloak from his shoulders and gently draped it around me."
	* She cries *
	Wizard: "For some reason it filled me with nostalgia."
	Wizard: "I think it reminded me of my father."
	Wizard: "Something about the way he used to wrap me in blankets as a child."
	* She laughs *
	Wizard: "And then that was it. He stoked the fire and sat back down across from me."
	Wizard: "The others sheathed their blades and joined us around the fire."
	Wizard: "My eyes must have been full of tears, just as they are now."
	Wizard: "Yet none of us spoke. We just sat under the stars, bearing the weight of what we'd become."
	* She nods slowly to herself. *
	Wizard: "That was the day we understood what the war had stolen from us:"
	Wizard: "Our empathy."
	* Alexandros pauses (...) *
	Alexandros: "I'm sorry to have brought this all up."
	Alexandros: "I really didn't mean to upset you..."
	* She shakes her head, smiling tearfully. *
	Wizard: "No, no. Not at all."
	Wizard: "I recognize now that was the best day of my life."
	Wizard: "His kindness saved me, you see. It saved us all."
	Wizard: "Because he dreamt of a different world. One free from our violence."
	Wizard: "And with a single action, he had *us* realize it as well."
	Wizard: "That's more imaginative than even the brightest artist."
	* She pauses again. *
	Wizard: "You know? I realize I've never told that story before. To anyone."
	Wizard: "So thank you all for listening to it."
	Alexandros: "I assure you, miss, the pleasure was most certainly ours."
	* She smiles warmly at the four of you, and you can't help but smile back. *
175. Conversation with a mystic/psychic
	Mystic: "In your wake, you leave death. Do you know what fills in that void?"
	[Chaos.]
	[Fear.]
	Mystic: "It's both."
	Aylmera: "Huh? I only said one thing."
	Mystic: "Yet you thought of two."
	Mystic: "The mind betrays truths about itself to the careful observer."
	Mystic: "Do I frighten you?"
	[Yes.]
	[No.]
	Mystic: "I believe you. Just make sure you believe yourself as well."
176. Conversation with soldiers from up North
	Aylmera: "Excuse me. I was wondering about the soldiers stationed here."
	Aylmera: "There's so many of you. How did you all manage to survive the Great Explosion?"
	Knight: "That old mess..."
	Knight: "It's because our Lord wisely deduced the tower's inherent danger."
	Knight: "A wicked citadel perched atop the hill. Like a preserved, ancient deadfall trap."
	Knight: "Our leader prevented us from being lured into its proximity."
	Aylmera: "Are you suggesting he knew it would explode ahead of time?"
	Knight: "Of course not. But in some ways, yes."
	Knight: "I doubt he foretold the particulars, but he saw that war for what it was."
	Knight: "A petty squabble between weak men. The only outcome involved no winners."
	Knight: "So, when our reserves were called to duty, he ensured we were stationed far from the frontlines."
	Knight: "Most the men you see here were protecting supply lines."
	Knight: "Thus, we avoided the initial blast and all its miserable fallout."
	[Sounds cowardly.]
		Knight: "The meek often use that word. Strange to hear it from a warrior..."
		Knight: "Take heed of the order that's been preserved here. The freedoms you enjoy are a merely privilege."
		Knight: "One which is bought through our sacrifice."
		Knight: "Meanwhile the South and East bleed together into one, miserable mass."
	[Sounds lucky.]
		Knight: "Not at all. It wasn't luck that led to our salvation."
		Knight: "It was experience. And wisdom. The wisdom of our Lord."
		Knight: "His careful actions protected us. And now we protect his lands."
		Knight: "It's a simple cycle. One that can self perpetuate in the right hands."
	Aylmera: "Do you feel you owe a debt to your Lord?"
	Knight: "Absolutely. We all do. For the very honor to engage in such a free and just society."
	Knight: "You foreigners especially. You haven't earned these rights through service, yet he still bestows them upon you."
	Knight: "You should be grateful for the privilege to frolick in our lands."
	*The Knight spits on the ground.*
	Knight: "...Are you?"
	[Yes.]
		Knight: "A liar from the South. You folk really are a reflection of your King."
	[No.]
		Knight: "Honesty. That's surprising, since you folk have such little respect for our values."
	*He just stares at you, unwilling to engage further. You've clearly disappointed him.*
177. Encounter with a psychopath
	- This occurs when Aylmera is separated from her party, after falling into the river. She is ambushed while alone.
	* Aylmera approaches a dead end clearing in the forest. *
	* A man approaches from the direction she entered, cutting off her only exit.*
	Man: "That's unusual armor you're wearing."
	* Aylmera is startled, and turns to face him. *
	Man: "Looks exotic. I imagine its come a long way to reach me."
	Aylmera: "It has."
	Man: "Bet it'd fetch a hefty price at auction. Especially in such *good* condition."
	* The man smiles forcefully, in an exaggerated manner. *
	Aylmera: "I'll keep that in mind."
	* Aylmera steps toward him, to leave. *
	Man: "Y'know what?"
	Man: "I'll buy it off you. Right here and now."
	Man: "Got the coin for it on me. I'm an honest sort, I'll give you a fair deal."
	Man: "Just take it off and we'll make the exchange."
	Aylmera: "..."
	* The man is upset that his ploy is failing so miserably. (bored face?) *
	Man: "Oh. Come now, miss. Don't think so low of me. I've no foul intentions."
	Man: "I'd just like to personally inspect the goods... personally."
	[Confront him.]
		Aylmera: "There's nothing honest about you."
	[Ignore his foolishness.]
		Aylmera: "How 'bout you step aside, instead?"
		* The man laughs *
		Man: "Yeah. I do, actually."
	Man: "Now, I don't like repeating myself..."
	Aylmera: "Then don't."
	Aylmera: "Draw your weapon. And let's be done with it."
	* The man is furious. *
	Man: "How dare you command me!"
	* He draws his weapon in anger. *
	* Aylmera smiles softly. *
	Aylmera: "Coward."
	* She charges him, triggering combat. *

	Custom death message after this encounter (if lost):
	"The man's movements are gentle and calculated. Yet his work is messy and grotesque. Working diligently, he mutilates your corpse with care. Your flesh and bones are soon unrecognizeable. Just another body hidden beneath the dense thicket of the forest."
178. Conversation with a spirit 
	Spirit: "It's just us now. You needn't fear any longer."
	Aylmera: "The only thing I fear..."
	Aylmera: "Is that the ability to fear left me long, long ago."
179. Neera's Foresight abandoning her
	- Upon leaving the Aether, Neera should have a small cutscene with the party, where she is surprised to still not hear the voice of God.
	- This both distresses and disappoints her, as she is uncertain whether God has abandoned her.
	- In this way she, too, is a character who finds herself lost and abandoned by the ideals she once held so strongly.
		~ But like everyone else, her fate is left unknown.
180. Ramblings of the devout (hostile religious zealot)
	Devoted: "Look into my eyes and witness God!"
	Aylmera: "Nay. It's time you be purged of your lucidity, wretch."
	Devoted: "Were you only able to meditate upon your own reflection, you would not be a heretic."
	* Aylmera initiates combat *
181. The King has already been dethroned from his castle
	- The castle the player awakens in is actually not the King's original castle. It is merely a large keep.
		~ In fact, it is the keep having belonged to the Lord.
	- Following the Great Explosion, the Lord's army (being further from the conflict), sent a regiment to the castle.
		~ There, his men conquered it easily, while the main army was away.
		~ The King was deployed closer to the battlefield at the time, preventing him from defending it.
		~ Moreover, the Lord's troops were directly in the way of any counter offensive.
		~ In the weeks following, the King took the last of his army and seized the Lord's keep.
			~ This was an act of both revenge, and necessity, as he needed a defensible position to fortify.
		~ With the decimation of his army abroad, and the loss of his castle at home, the King now barely has any influence.
	- This explains the presence of the oubliette and other unsavory things in the initial castle.
	- This allows the Northern castle to be significantly larger than the initial one.
	- This explains the additional cruelty of the soldiers toward the peasants in the past (as noted by the locals).
	- This allows documents detailing core parts of what happened in the Great Explosion to be found in the Northern castle, further into the game.
182. Conversation with Alexandros on religion
	Alexandros: "Forgive me Neera, but theology is the waste of an educated man's talents."
	Alexandros: "It concerns itself with whimsical questions that lack concrete answers."
	Alexandros: "For example, maybe you've heard of this one, Aylmera:"
	Alexandros: "'They say God no longer walks among the living, for he lives in *fear* of his own creation.'"
	Neera: *Laughs to herself*
	Alexandros: "Oh? It seems Neera is familiar with it."
	Neera: "Hardly. But I'm familiar enough with God himself."
	Neera: "And he's certainly never shared such a feeling with me."
	Alexandros: *Rolls his eyes*
	Alexandros: "And you trust him to be truthful to you about all things?"
	Neera: "Absolutely not. But I've known both fear and the fearful."
	Neera: "And he exhibits the traits of neither."
	Alexandros: "I'm not sure you're qualified to see such matters without bias. Besides..."
	Alexandros: "I want to hear Aylmera's opinion on the matter."
	Alexandros: "Who do you think is more dangerous: Man, or God?"
	[Man.]
		Alexandros: "I agree. If he doesn't already, God should most certainly fear us."
		Alexandros: "He has good reason to."
	[God.]
		Alexandros: "Really?"
		Alexandros: "Then you must blame the almighty for at least some of the atrocities we've witnessed."
		Alexandros: "Suppose it's a comforting thought, at least."
		Alexandros: "That we aren't the only ones responsible for the horrors around us."
	* Alexandros pauses (...) *
	Alexandros: "Sorry to bring down the mood. Perhaps the Jester could brighten our spirits?"
	Jester: "Sure, I've got one."
	Jester: "Knock, Knock."
	Alexandros: "Who's there?"
	Jester: "The consequences of your own actions."
	* Alexandros frowns, slightly embarrassed (:/) *
183. Jester and Alexandros talking about their shared trauma
	Jester: "Alexandros. I've been meaning to ask you:"
	Jester: "Do you often dream? Of the night of the explosion?"
	*Alexandros looks sullen/somber *
	Alexandros: "I wouldn't call them dreams. But certainly nightmares, yes."
	Jester: "Mmm. That's something we can definitely agree on."
	Jester: "Do you see the faces of your comrades as well?"
	Alexandros: "Somewhat. I see them in pieces. Both literally and figuratively."
	Alexandros: "It's strange though. Each time it's as though my memory... shifts. A little bit."
	Alexandros: "I remember the names of so many dead. Yet in my dreams their faces fade one-by-one."
	* Jester is shocked (!) *
	Jester: "Indeed! I've witnessed the same with my mind."
	Jester: "It's comforting to hear your similar experience. For many years I thought it was just my poor memory."
	Jester: "I remember one man in particular... A vassal with whom I was barely acquainted."
	* Jester laughs *
	Jester: "He had such a strange moustache. Waxed and curled twice at the tips."
	Jester: "I remember pulling him from the muck of battle, checking him for breath: his face a mangled mess of ash and blood."
	Jester: "And I remember how it felt, seeing his contorted features illuminated in the blue flames of the night."
	* Jester pauses *
	Jester: "But when I *dream* of that night, and step foot into the memory, his face is empty. Dark, with a smoothness like marble."
	* Alexandros nods *
	Alexandros: "It's haunting. And certainly no coincidence. I've experienced much the same: it's exactly as you describe."
	Alexandros: "Their faces used to number so many. And now they're so few. With each night containing fewer and fewer."
	- This is all a reference to the strange effect that being in the Aether at all (e.g. during the initial blast) has had.
	- The faces of the dead disappearing from their memories
184. Comment on the sailors fleeing by ship to the North
	- "They traded one deep blue for another. May the sea be more gentle to them than the Aether."
185. Allow the player to inspect mass graves outside in the initial castle, and then return to the King to confront him about it.
	- He'll admit, reluctantly, that they're the bodies of his enemies. That he claimed the keep from his enemies to the North. Former allies.
	- Regardless, he doubles down on Aylmera's necessity to his cause, and urges her to complete the mission.
186. Adjust the plot slightly. Alexandros must go to the Northern castle to retrieve the Orb there, but it's known to be dangerous.
	- He's infiltrating with a small group of soldiers to perform a heist of sorts.
	- This, of course, fails. Resulting in his crew being tortured and killed. Thus, the player must rescue him.
187. Neera's perspective on the sins of the modern priesthood
	- Neera: "Your sins are beyond absolution. To smite you has become necessity."
	- Priest: "Nonsense. Your madness has made you blind to the faith."
	- Priest: "God absolves through the Sacrament's confession."
	- Neera: "No. His whispers were clear upon my ears."
	- Neera: "Your behaviors are more grave than even Mortal sins. Such acts cannot be forgiven."
188. The Jester and Alexandros disagreeing on their past politics
	- Alexandros blames the King for initiating the conflict, despite the Wizards overtly making an assassination attempt first.
	- Moreover, a conversation about their disagreements over how things are reflected in history.
	- Jester: "Though the King doesn't regard the Great War as a mistake, you must admire his consideration for our future."
	- Jester: "The undead threaten us all. Thus he commits himself to preserving every citizen of the Realm, regardless of their prior loyalties."
	- Jester: "Could the same be said for your mad leader?"
	- Alexandros: "Pfft. Who's to say?"
	- Alexandros: "Your King has the privilege of being alive and choosing to refine his political will."
	- Alexandros: "My liege is not afforded such an opportunity in death."
	- Alexandros: "To paint him as a warmonger regardless of circumstance is neither fair, nor rational."
	- Alexandros: "Were he to see things as they are now, certainly his views would be amended in *some* manner."
	- Alexandros: "These are unprecendented times, after all. The significance of such events was never lost on him."
	- Alexandros: "Even at his least lucid, his mentality was grounded."
	"He has the luxury of changing his mind (because he's alive)."
189. Consider having the Garrison destroyed after you perform the stabilization ritual
	- This would be a result of you hassling the horde. A thing which the leaders of the Garrison could warn you about.
	- As such, the only colony that's remotely moral and just would be defeated as well. Indirectly by your hands.
190. Conversation with Neera after falling into the River
	* Perhaps Neera has an odd reaction to you falling, such as laughing. Or a non-chalant, "Goodbye" with a smile, whereas the Jester shouts something like, "Aylmera! No!"
	Aylmera: "Neera. There's something I have to ask you."
	Aylmera: "When I fell from the bridge, you showed little concern. And no surprise."
	Aylmera: "How did you know I would fall? And why let it happen?"
	Neera: (*smirks*)
	Neera: "The better question is how I knew you would return."
	Neera: "While I don't share everything I see, I've never once lied to you."
	Neera: "To *either* of you." *She shoots a glance in the Jester's direction.*
	Neera: "Had I warned you of the danger on the bridge, it's true you would not have fallen into the waters below."
	Neera: "Instead you would have fallen in battle shortly after. Just outside the city walls."
	Neera: "I've no explanation for how those outcomes are connected."
	Neera: "But I can tell you that our separation was a necessity for your survival."
	Aylmera: "Is that so? Seems awfully convenient."
	Neera: "I've meditated extensively on that bridge. I assure you, it was the safest solution."
	Neera: "After viewing hundreds of scenarios where my intervention meant your death: my mind reached a consensus."
	Neera: "Given so many trials, wouldn't you agree your safety was almost a certainty?"
	Aylmera: "You know that trust is *earned* and not given, yes?"
	Jester: "Aylmera. If I may interject for a moment."
	Jester: "In your absence, I protested against Neera's insistence to move forward."
	Jester: "I suggested we search the riverbank for you. Or assemble a search party."
	Jester: "But she was certain you would return to us on your own."
	Jester: "She made no hesitations as we progressed, and dare I say..."
	Jester: "She even predicted your arrival to the hour."
	Jester:  *Sighs*
	Jester: "I don't like it any more than you. And I'm hesitant to believe in some alleged 'visions'."
	Jester: "But I feel certain that fall would have killed anyone else."
	Jester: "Yet you've returned to us largely unharmed. Just as the priestess described."
	Jester: "Perhaps she really did protect you. And our mission."
	Aylmera: *Thinking* (...)
	Aylmera: "Since I can't force you to share all you that know, Neera."
	Aylmera: "I'll only insist on one thing:"
	Aylmera: "From here on out, you-"
	Neera: "Never separate the group again."
	Aylmera: *(?!) She's taken aback. *
	Neera: "Is that enough evidence of my gifts?"
	Neera: *Laughs*
	Neera: "I'll abide your request."
	Neera: "And for what it's worth: it's good to be reunited."
	* The party rejoins into Aylmera. *
191. A discussion about societal healing
	Attempting to get past a knight who's standing guard in the Lord's Castle.
	Knight: "Halt! Heretics aren't permitted inside the gate. Return from whence you came."
	Neera: "And why is it we're not allowed inside?"
	Knight: "Because you're a risk to our peace. You don't share our values."
	Neera: "Is that so? So it's a philosophical difference? Hm."
	Neera: "You know, the truth of our predicament is quite simple."
	Neera: "The best possible outcome for everyone would be to reconcile."
	Neera: "To find a common ground wherein we could heal."
	Neera: "To melt our hatred of one another away as we form a common bond."
	Neera: "Such an experience is to witness *true* beauty."
	*Neera pauses (...)*
	Neera: "Yet few ever make it far enough to even glimpse such a chance."
	Neera: "Fewer still will ever face it."
	Neera: "For most of us, healing in this way is an impossibility."
	Neera: "Because it requires an immense level of self-reflection."
	Neera: "An ability to empathize with your own soul as much as that of an enemy."
	Neera: "To us rabble, acknowleding the pain we've caused is simply a burden too great to face."
	Neera: "Our revulsion to our sins blinds us with shame."
	Neera: "Thus, most are left right where we find ourselves now."
	Neera: "Stuck. Stubborn. And Stoic."
	*Neera smiles, pleased with herself.*
	*Knight takes a defensive stance, on their backfoot.*
	Knight: "Just what are you insinuating, priestess?"
	Neera: "Are you so blind? There's only one pathway forward for both of us."
	Aylmera: "Through one another."
	Aylmera: "And *we're* unwavering. Are you?"
	*Knight is terrified (disturbed? agitated?)*
	Knight: "Keep your distance, witch!" (bruja? should Velazquez's men reference Spanish)
	Aylmera: "Make me."
	*Aylmera charges into combat*
192. Stranger reflecting on their distaste for the new leadership in the Capital City Castle
	Stranger: "We aren't alike, you and I. I'm a stranger in my homeland. You're but a stranger visting my homeland."
	Stranger: "Can you understand what I mean?"
193. Deeper Morality and Reasoning of the Bandit Queen (Vivian)
	- Help the player understand their side more, even if it's wrong.
	- Their cardinal flaw is they're short-sighted and self-centered. Focused solely on themselves and their own goals.
	- When first meeting the bandits, they fight you because they feel you're a spy sent by the King.
		~ They're unwilling to trust you, despite your protests, making them unable to move past the mistakes of the past.
		~ They fail to imagine the stakes have changed. Although they're outsiders to the initial conflict (Wizards vs. Soldiers),
		they still are fighting for the results of THAT previous conflict. Attempting to dethrone a King who has already given up.
		~ As such, they stand in the way of true progress, of recognizing the sincere, significant threats coming for them (namely Aether).
	- END GAME: The Bandit Queen wants to fight you only after you reveal she has no remaining outs, and chide her for it.
		~ Until this point, she is actively trying to recruit you. Still driven by her own goals and conquest.
		~ The bandits want to unify the Realm for reasons that are only relevant to the war which has already ended.
	- This personal criticism of her incompetence is what ultimately unveils her rage and triggers the final fight.
	- Despite all her talk of revolution, she is ultimately vain and short-sighted. A ruler most unfit for the throne.
194. Neera sharing more about her background in the church
	Aylmera: "Neera. The Pope knew you by your first name."
	Aylmera: "What exactly is your history with the church?"
	* Neera hesitates. *
	Neera: "It's a rather complicated one."
	Aylmera: "Indulge us the details."
	Neera: "Well, it started when I was a child."
	Neera: "You see, I spent much of my youth bed-ridden and ailing."
	Neera: "Though born to nobility, my bloodline was tainted with weakness. And I succumbed disease early."
	Neera: "My family paid countless doctors and apothecaries to treat my illness, but none had long-term remedies."
	Neera: "Out of desperation, they turned to the church, and introduced me to the clergy."
	Neera: "I couldn't tell you why, but of all the treatments I endured: only the rituals of the church healed me."
	* Sigmund rolls his eyes. *
	Sigmund: "Has your God confirmed that for you?"
	Neera: "As a matter of fact, he hasn't. He ignores my questions on the subject."
	Neera: "It's one of the few things he refuses to answer, so I presume it to be his intervention."
	Neera: "Regardess, having spent many years locked in my room alone, I learned to read at a very young age."
	Neera: "I enjoyed the comfort of pages with worlds to explore."
	Neera: "Once I had healed enough to leave my bed, the priests took note of my natural intellect and invited me into the clergy."
	Neera: "By my 12th birthday, I was sent as a ward to the priesthood."
	Aylmera: "You've yet to mention how the Pope knew you personally. Certainly that's an honor bestow to few."
	Neera: "Indeed it is. And it's because for many years I was a High Priestess."
	Neera: "The second-highest rank a woman can possess in the clergy."
	Neera: "They were grooming me for High Inquisitor."
	* Aylmera is surprised (?!) *
	Aylmera: "You intended to *kill* for these people?"
	Neera: "No! Far from it."
	Neera: "It's difficult to imagine now, but we used to be committed to non-violence."
	Neera: "My specialty was in translation and research. I was an interrogator, yes. But of facts."
	Neera: "However, under the latest authority of the Pope, our duties began to shift."
	Neera: "Much of the scripture now teaches compliance to violent ideals."
	Aylmera: "Why would the Pope advocate for such a thing? And why would the church agree to it?"
	Aylmera: "Does violence not conflict directly with the word of your holy texts?"
	Neera: "Reading the text at face-value, it most certainly does."
	Neera: "As such, many of the old texts have been redacted or revised."
	Neera: "You see, the role of the papacy is unique in its ability to alter the teachings of God."
	Neera: "The Pope is to be his right hand. Listening to his word directly, whilst disseminating new teachings to the rest of the church."
	* Sigmund laughs (snorts?) *
	Sigmund: "Pfft. Give me a break..."
	Sigmund: "That definition would make *you* the rightful Pope, would it not?"
	* Neera leers at Sigmund *
	Neera: "Indeed it would. If I had an delusions of grandeur."
	Neera: "Impressive how you manage to find such comedy amidst my tragedy, jester."
	Neera: "I'm sure your King misses your antics greatly."
	* Neera snarkily smiles "politely" at Sigmund. *
	Neera: "Nevertheless, given the Pope's status in the clergy, his word and that of God are treated one and the same."
	Alexandros: "Forgive me for my doubts, but if God is speaking to the Pope, then how can you be certain who you hear is truly the voice of the almighty?"
	* Neera smiles, genuinely *
	Neera: "Because it's been an open secret in the church for years now."
	Neera: "The Pope no longer hears the voice of God."
	Neera: "He communes in complete silence."
	* Aylmera pauses, in thought (...)
	Aylmera: "I'm still confused on the matter. What would drive the Pope to such extremes?"
	Aylmera: "Why usurp the almighty and modify the holy texts to his own accord?"
	Neera: "I am not privy to the secrets of any man's mind."
	Neera: "Yet when I knew the Pope, he was a decent man."
	Neera: "If I had to guess, he believes himself honestly doing the work of God."
	Neera: "After all, how is a man amidst the fear and uncertainty of civil war to interpret silence?"
	Neera: "Make no doubt. He has become a cruel and evil man. But he believes himself righteous."
	Neera: "I needn't ask God for certainty on that."
195. Encounter (with the bloodhound?) at the Fishing Village
	- The player should encounter him staring out (UP on the screen) at the sea. The gentle noise of the ocean, as he happily admires the natural beauty.
	- This is in stark, and direct contrast to the massive pile of corpses from the group suicide that's directly nearby. Perhaps even in frame (or just out of frame).
	- This enounter should feel peaceful, it's about someone finding stillness, and calmness amidst chaos.
		~ As reacting to chaos with stillness is a common response.
196. Many of the soldiers (across the realm) should fall into conspiratorial idolatry of their leaders
	- This is a trait that is exhibited even today in many political groups.
	- Individuals conflate themselves with their leaders, and are unable to imagine that their goals or ideals might diverge from that of their leaders.
	- Thus, they super-impose their ego onto their leaders and view them as near-infallible.
197. Regretful warrior
	Man: "Used to think I had it all figured out."
	Man: "Kept the peace, maintained order. Fought only when necessary."
	Man: "Carried myself with dignity. Followed a code. Even allowed myself the sin of Pride."
	Man: "Then one day, some bandit had the audacity to question my morality."
	Man: "Said the steel in my sword would've been better used as a plowshare. Hmph."
	Man: "He lamented what I'd become. What this world had molded me into."
	Man: "When he first spoke the words, I didn't hear them."
	Man: "But my pride certainly did."
	Man: "I shoved my blade through his throat as soon as the words left his mouth."
	Man: "But it was too late. He'd planted the idea in my head."
	Man: "And my sword couldn't silence the echoes of his wisdom."
	Man: "Now every day I suffer, because of his spoken truth."
	Man: "All while that lucky bastard rests easy in some grave."
	Man: "Stupid son of a bitch knew me better than I knew myself..."
	*The man pauses, thinking for a moment. (...)*
	Man: "Have you ever doubted the path you're on?"
	[Yes.]
	Man: "Then you know my pain."
	[No.]
	Man: "Give it some time. You'll come around."
198. Conversations with the Apothecary
	* This conversation should occur after the group has gone into the ruins and attempted to find the stone, to no avail (it's not where they were told it was located by the King).
	* The Apothecary approaches the group from behind, as they're almost leaving the screen. *
	Apothecary: "Ah! How good for our paths to cross once more!"
	* Aylmera and the party turn to face the Apothecary. *
	Apothecary: "You'll have to forgive me for bothering you again."
	Apothecary: "My followers mentioned you were here on important business."
	Apothecary: "I'd imagine your time is very precious."
	Jester: "Oft is the case with Royal matters."
	Jester: "Is there something we can assist you with?"
	Apothecary: "Yes. There is."
	Apothecary: "Aylmera. My followers mentioned that you have aspirations to save the Realm."
	Apothecary: "Would that be correct?"
	Aylmera: "Yes. I believe I mentioned that to one of them."
	Apothecary: "Yet when we first met, you made no mention of such a thing."
	Jester: "We stated we were here on behalf of the Crown."
	Apothecary: "In the role of scouts, if I remember correctly."
	Apothecary: "Scouting's hardly a pathway to the heroics of saving a Realm."
	Apothecary: "So I must ask: Why did you lie to me?"
	Aylmera: "I'm sorry? I don't think I've lied to you."
	Aylmera: "Are you accusing me of... having aspirations?"
	Apothecary: "Quite the opposite, actually."
	Apothecary: "I'm accusing you of revealing your hand to me."
	Apothecary: "You're not here to scout. You're here for your aspirations."
	Apothecary: "And I'd wager *this* has something to do with them."
	* The Apothecary holds out the Elemental stone in her hand, showing it to the party from afar. *
	Jester: "The stone! What do you want with it?"
	Apothecary: "Well, for starters, knowing that I hold this, I'd like to know which way you intend to proceed."
	Apothecary: "Back to the village? Or toward me..."
	Aylmera: "Enough games! You know we want it, so why not hand it over?"
	Aylmera: "You and your people have no use for it. You know we mean you no harm."
	Apothecary: "Perhaps not today. But your ilk always spell trouble for the Realm."
	Apothecary: "Answer me this:"
	Apothecary: "What sort of future do you wish you build for the Realm?"
	Apothecary: "Is it one which considers the needs of *all* its members?"
	Aylmera: "Of course! We all deserve what's best for us."
 	Apothecary: "Yet you walk the path of the sword."
	Apothecary: "The only tool you've mastered is one of destruction."
	Apothecary: "You bear no hammer to build homes with, nor a sickle for harvesting grain."
	Apothecary: "Instead you came with only with a blade on your hip. Why is that?"
	Jester: "This is preposterous! We all have different roles to play in securing peace across the land."
	Jester: "To treat matters so one-dimensionally is absurd."
	Apothecary: "How enlightening. However, I'd like to hear *her* answer, jester."
	Apothecary: "Aylmera, why did you become a warrior?"
	[I don't know.]
		Apothecary: "How profoundly sad. And yet so uninspired..."
	[It's all I know.]
		Apothecary: "Ponder that, and there might be hope for you yet."
	Apothecary: "If I don't give you this stone, do you intend to take it by force?"
	Aylmera: "You already know my answer."
	Apothecary: "Then you understand how I feel."
	Apothecary: "Handing you the stone can only breed further devastation for our people."
	Apothecary: "It's safest here, hidden beneath the ground."
	* The Apothecary pauses, exasperated (...). *
	Apothecary: "But I know your kind."
	Apothecary: "Even if facing certain defeat, you wouldn't reconsider..."
	Apothecary: "Defeating you lot might be our only chance at peace."
	* The Apothecary assumes a combat stance and charges forward. *
199. Try designing a picture in frame of a hand gripping the hilt of their sword more tightly.
	- Could be used mid-dialogue to demonstrating rising tension between characters.
	- Or simply to demonstrate when Aylmera is nervous/stressed by a line of questioning.
200. Chat with a zealot
	- "Do you not see God in yourself?"
	- "No. I see myself in God."
201. Conversation with a non-believer
	NB: "Have you heard the rumors?"
	NB: "Some say we're not the first of God's children to inhabit this Earth."
	NB: "That others lived and died long before we ever did."
	Neera: "The scriptures are quite clear about the beginning of man."
	Neera: "I could suggest you some passages if you'd like."
	NB: "Indeed. I've heard much of the holy book through the clergy."
	NB: "But what of our history remembers such events?"
	NB: "Isn't it possible we came along much later?"
	Aylmera: "If all our ancestors died off, where do you think we came from?"
	NB: "They didn't die off. They were *killed* off. By God himself."
	NB: "Wiped away in a wave of holy fire."
	NB: "Then he went and created us afterward."
	NB: "An attempt to fix something he'd gotten wrong the first time."
	Neera: *Apprehensively* "And why would God do such a thing to his own creation?"
	NB: "Because they wouldn't stop fighting."
	NB: "Sometimes it's easier to just start over."
202. Insulting nickname for Velazquez
	Stranger: "He's no leader. Should be called Lord Vanitas."
		~ Vanitas is latin for 'Vanity', as in futility.
203. Discussions of Ambition and human futility. Inside Velazquez's city.
	* An old woman starts conversing with the party as she looks forlornly at the castle inside the city. *
	"No happiness lies within that castle's walls."
	"It houses too many men with desires. Worldly desires."
	"Their ambitions are but another name for vanity."
	"You're headed that way. I presume to share in ambitions of your own?"
	Aylmera: "Yes. Modest ones."
	* The old woman smiles softly *
	"I'm afraid there's no such thing."
	"Every accomplishment ends with failure."
	"You'll know this when the earth consumes your bones, and time undoes your actions."
	"In that moment, you'll share in the despair of all those who came before you."
	* Aylmera pauses for a moment in thought *
	Aylmera: "Did you once have ambitions of your own?"
	"I wouldn't be human if I didn't."
	Neera: "The path of futility oft traps us in suffering."
	Neera: "For our acknowledgement of pain makes it feel inescapable."
	Neera: "But it is through understanding that one can experience pain freely."
	Neera: "And to be unburdened by pain, is the first step to enlightenment."
	* The woman thinks about it, touched by the wisdom *
	"Forgive me priestess, I don't know my scriptures as well as I should."
	"From which book do you quote?"
	Neera: "None."
	Neera: "This wisdom was shown to through experience. And it was explained by the Divine."
	"Well, may the Divine bless you for sharing it with me."
	"Nevertheless. Be wary of the men in that castle."
	"They know far more about suffering than you or I ever could..."
204. Design a scene or moment where Aylmera (and the player) must face an enemy eye-to-eye
	- Draw this scene from a first-person POV, with her gaze rising to look an enemy in the eye.
	- "To meet his gaze requires great courage. To look away: shame." (Quote from Oneirology)
205. Wisdom from the ancients
	- Many a man has been forced to choose between the path of uncertainty, and the path of mediocrity. (Quote from Oneirology)
206. Centering multiple elements of the characters and the story-telling around eyes seems consequential.
207. Consider telling the story as a series of disconnected vignettes with dream sequences interspersed.
	- Since many of the ideas here are centered around emotion and feeling, this might make more sense.
	- Moreover, it could add a confused feeling to both the player AND Aylmera.
		~ To everyone else she could literally be disassociating. Meanwhile, she is confused how she gets from one place to the next.
	- The dream sequences should have a cloudy tileset, as though everything is apparated out of or amidst clouds.
	- Over time, Aylmera could slip into these more frequently, causing distress to her party and their ability to defend themselves.
208. Could have 3 recurring characters in the dream states (brothers of the dreamstate from Ovid's Metamorphoses)
	- Phobetor (appears only in nightmares, feeds off human fear)
		~ Described as appearing as the manifestation of terror.
		~ Aylmera could develop the courage to face him without waking, and learn to converse with him.
		~ "He appeared in dreams 'in the form of beast or bird or the long serpent'." (from Wikipedia)
	- Phantasos (appears as inanimate objects)
		~ Could make him very strange objects that are absurdly out-of-place. E.g. A palm tree.
		~ Could have him initially not say anything, but can be conversed with as the dreams progress.
	- Morpheus (appears in human form)
	- They are the sons of Somnus. One of his thousands of sons.
209. Alexandros in the dreamscape (consider making this encounter more abstract)
	* This could be before the party saves him from Velazquez.
	* Alexandros approaches the player toward the end of a dream sequence *
	???: "WAIT! Aylmera! What are you doing here?!"
	* Aylmera is surprised (?!) *
	[Alexander?]
		* Alexandros is disappointed (:/) *
		Alexandros: "Couldn't be bothered to remember my name?"
	[Alexandros?]
		Alexandros: "Who else would it be?"
	Alexandros: "Look, things haven't gone to plan. You and that jester need to come find me. NOW."
	Aylmera: "What are you talking about? How did you find me? How are you even here?"
	Alexandros: "LISTEN TO ME!"
	Alexandros: "We've displeased the Lord. You must save us."
	Alexandros: "We're in chains. He'll execute us the next chance he gets."
	Alexandros: "Stop dawdling and come get us."
	Aylmera: "And how do you expect me to do that?"
	Alexandros: "Fear works wonders."
	Aylmera: "What do y- *Hngh*"
	* He grasps your throat tightly with his bare hands. *
	Aylmera: "S-stop..." (you mutter)
	* You try to pry his hands from your neck, but his grip is too tight. *
	* Ignoring your pleas, he stares deeply into your eyes. *
	Alexandros: "Look at me."
	* You notice a single tear welling in his right eye. *
	Alexandros: "Fail me and I'll haunt you from the afterlife."
	* His teeth are gritted together as he utters the words. *
	Alexandros: "FIND ME!"
	* The screen fades to white. *
	* Aylmera awakens from the dream in a coughing fit. *
	(For clarity on the lore, I imagine that Alexandros' magical knowledge allows him to meditate and attempt communication with other realms, such as those of dreams.)
210. Conversation inside the Dream Realm (perhaps with Morpheus)
	Aylmera: "Tell me spirit, am I undead?"
	Aylmera: "Cursed like the Aether-stricken, but somehow lucid?"
	Spirit: "No. Your ailment differs from theirs significantly."
	Spirit: "They are unified with Death."
	Spirit: "Whereas you are Deathless."
	Aylmera: "What does that mean?"
	Spirit: "That we cannot claim you until the time is right."
	Aylmera: "So I'm... immortal?"
	Spirit: "Do you feel immortal?"
	Aylmera: "Hardly. I feel weak."
	Spirit: "Precisely. Because your time runs low."
	Spirit: "Finish your business topside. Then return to us here."
211. Realization bestowed upon Aylmera after many dream sequences
	Aylmera: "They cannot reap my soul before my time is up."
	Aylmera: "They called me 'Deathless'."
212. Why was the Great Tower originally built?
	- TBD
213. Reason for the Fire Stone being in the Bandit Queen's possession
	- It was being transported by the last of the King's men to him. But was intercepted enroute.
	- Simply put: She stole it. And because it seemed important, she kept it.
	- This should probably also be the first direction that the King points you in for your mission.
214. Enemy/Villain defending themselves and their actions
	Enemy: "They are monsters. I am merely monstrous." (The implication being the monsters (likely the undead) are monsters ALL the time. This person is merely engaged in a moment of being a monster.)
	Enemy: "There will be a day your delusion fades."
	Enemy: "And on that day you'll inherit my perspective."
	Enemy: "But I can see it on your face."
	Enemy: "You don't believe such a thing is possible."
	Enemy: "Your preconceptions are the chains which bind you."
215. Zealots who voluntarilty undergo torture while meditating	
	- They see it as a way to truly achieve zen. Being able to pray and be at peace even when you're physically harmed.
	- An extreme form of mind over matter.
216. "Suicide of the Goddess"
	- An idea for a famous statue or painting in the game, depicting a beloved goddess ending her own life due to her suffering.

Names for Chapters/Sections:
==============================

		~ At this moment, the friendship and comradery of the party should be realized in full.

Combat System Ideas:
====================
May 2024:
----------
Characters and their attacks:
1. Aylmera
	- High damage, and High HP. Decent defense.
	- Uses large 2h bastard sword.
	- Offensive attacks. Slashes, stabs, overheads, and underhands.
2. Jester
	- Medium damage. Medium HP. Decent defense.
	- Uses a Misericorde (dagger for finishing off the wounded) and a lute for playing music (buffs).
		~ Can apply poison via the dagger with some attacks.
	- Has a combination of stabbing attacks, a few buffs (to increase damage, or to weaken enemy damage) 
3. Neera
	- Low damage. Low HP. Low defense.
	- Wields a cross and holy bible. Low HP.
	- Heals and buffs the rest of the party (or everyone, with a tiny bit for herself). Applies holy DoTs to enemies (which is strong against undead).
		~ Perhaps totally unable to damage enemies, or only very few attacks.
		~ Or moves where the main effect is a status effect, and there's a small bit of damage added additionally or over time.
		~ If she's squishy, with limited ways to assist herself, then pulling her out to play is risky, preventing turtling on her for long periods.
4. Alexandros
	- High damage. Medium HP. Low defense.
	- Magical spells.  His arms should ideally match the arrows being pressed when a spell is cast 
		~ Attacks often cause a DoT in addition to damage (such as fireballs).
		~ Has access to many different elemental attacks, allowing for more nuance in addressing enemy weaknesses. (Earth, Water, Wind, Fire)

* While the goal is to encourage a mixed playstyle of all the characters, if a player's good enough with one, they should be able to prioritize using them.
	- Keep in mind the option to win no matter the character selected.
* Will all the combos for all 4 characters simply be too much shit to memorize?
	- Aim to reuse Attack Combos between characters, but change what is done.
	- This would reduce the amount a player is required to learn in order to play effectively.
* Draw HP bars as background tiles

Keybinds:
-----------
Arrow keys = Attack chains
A = Lock in Attack to Combo
Hold A = Activate Combo
Select = Pop most recent Attack off combo chain
	- Simply tapping this a few times could be used to clear combos instead of a "full clear" button elsewhere
Hold Select = Swap character backward (previous character)
Start = Pause
B = Dodge
Hold B = Swap character forward (next character)
	- When the B button is held:
		- If (next character exists & next character not dead)
			- Then swap to next character.
			- Else, check for the next character in the chain.
			- If the next character is the current character, don't swap, and exit this logic chain. 

* PartyConfig and determining the active members in the party
	Possible team comps:
		1. Aylmera alone
		2. Aylmera + Jester
		3. Aylmera + Jester + Neera
		4. Aylmera + Jester + Neera + Alexandros
	- Should I simply design it to allow for all possible combos? Nah. That feels like over designing.

* CurrentCharacter values:
	0 = Aylmera (default)
		- Think of how to save this value. Initialize it perhaps when starting a new game.
		- I would love it if the last character used could be saved. But ensure that it never gets desynced from who is in the active party.
	1 = Jester
	2 = Neera
	3 = Alexandros

* Swapping a character clears your combo as well. As the new character has different attacks.
* Ideally, each character has a different healthbar.
	- Once all active party members are dead, it's game over.

Have HP increased by learning lore or exploring the world, directly.
	- E.g. "Your Compassion has increased."
	- Could also tie different emotions to each character's HP bar, so different characters can be buffed based on player choice.
	- Rewards the player for learning different things about the world. 

Select should lock in your attack chain (current move), and HOLDING it will purge your whole combo chain.
	- This will allow your left hand to be entirely responsible for creating and locking in combos, and free up the A button.
Holding B could swap between characters?
Consider a UI overlay for showing health and/or current attack combo (arrows) at the bottom of the screen.
Also consider ways to change between characters to fight as mid combat.
	- Should be able to "overload" the player sprite with "Change Spritesheet" events.
	- "SEEMLESS REAL TIME ANIMATIONSHEET CHANGE" on GB Studio discord has more info.
Could draw combo chain icons to the background tiles (as they're static on the screen), and wipe/redraw them as needed via Tile swapping.

Moves, their Combos, and their Icons:
(Would love a combination of up to 5 attacks in a combo chain. 4 could do if necessary. 3 feels like the minimum.)
	- So it's X many combos to the power of 5 options on the individual sprite sheet.
	- As many as something like 8 possible inputs per attack seems reasonable. 10 is probably the upper limit you can expect someone to remember at ALL.
		~ Obviously have easier ones that are less and easier to remember. The longer it is, the more situational it should perhaps be.
		~ Though quick things which are situational allows fast reflexes to apply them to a combo.

This needs some ideas for how to draw all the necessary info to screen. Perhaps showing the chain of inputs is unrealistic.
	- Still, one arrow icon "dancing" as each input is entered could provide valuable info to the player.
	- Then, when an attack is locked in, it can simply have a unique icon show what type of attack is locked in.

Right now, the enemy will be attacking and having certain attacks, which require the player to pay attention and dodge during.
	- This will lead to enemy exhaustion phases, where a player can more easily focus SOLELY on comboing and attacking with little to no threats to dodge.
	- However, a strong player can input combos WHILE dodging, allowing them to take further advantage of the exhaustion period.


1. Left Slash
	- Combo: Left, Left, Left
	- Icon:

2. Right Slash
	- Combo: Right, Right, Right,
	- Icon: 

4. Underhand (Underhaw)
	- Combo: Down, Down, Up, Left, Right, Up
	- Icon: A single U, for "Underhand"

5. Forward Thrust (Stab)
	- Combo: Down, Down, Up
		~ Mimics pulling the sword back toward yourself, then ramming it forward in a straight line.
	- Icon: A bunch of arrows point toward the center of the icon (like many spear tips), or a singular spear tip that seems to be moving "upward" in the icon.

6. Right Diagonal Slash (Overhead)
	- Combo:  Up, Up, Left, Right, Down, Right, Down
		~ Mimics hoisting a sword up to the leftside of your body before striking down to the right.
	- Icon: 

7. Left Diagonal Slash (Overhead)
	- Combo: Up, Up, Right, Left, Down, Left, Down
		~ Mimics hoisting a sword up to the rightside of your body before striking down to the left.
	- Icon: 

8. Spinning Slash
	- Combo: Left, Down, Right, Up, Left, Down, Right, Up
		~ Mimics spinning around in 2 circles
	- Icon:


Conceptually need to do all these things, but within the control scheme of the Gameboy:
1. Assemble combos (up to some max based on icon limits)
2. Trigger an attack sequence
3. Dodge
4. Cancel a partially-built combo
5. Cancel an entire combo chain (or maybe just pop attacks one-by-one from the list?)
6. Dodge mid-way through a combo assembly (perhaps this clears the active combo chain)
7. Healing in combat?
	- Could be done via successfully landing combos. Essentially lifesteal. "HP" meter could be stylized as "Morale".
8. Visually show when an attack is locked in succesfully (and added to the combo list)
9. Show when an input attack is not a valid attack chain, and show it either failing to be added to the combo (or being added as a bad attack)
10. Show when a combo is maxed out, and no further attacks can be added to it.
	- Perhaps the list of directions could jiggle with the last entered input, signaling that nothing further can be added.
11. A simple health bar, which depletes as the player is hit by enemy attacks.
12. Consider showing a frame of the player posing in the attack once it's added to the combo chain.
	- E.g. If an Overhead slash was locked in, flash the player in the first frame of that attack for a moment to visually signal it being locked in.

Two separate things could be communicated on screen via icons:
	a. The current attack (denoted by some directional combo, e.g. -> <- -> ->)
	b. The current Combo (a collection of attacks) denoted by different icons (e.g. a single tile for each one representing the type of attack)
		- This would be a list of individual attacks: Uppercut, Stab, Slash, Overhead, etc.
			~ Each of these attacks would likely need an animation.
			~ The attack animation could be timed to dodge certain enemy attacks? Or is that insane to ask a player to pull off?

Consider having part of the Combo give the player invulnerability during its execution as a reward.
	- For example, the final hit of the combo could do this, so it could trade with opponents.
Increase the damage dealt by attacks which are part of an attack combo.

Actual implementation:
	Arrow Keys: Show the last input entered in the bottom right. It determines the player's current attack.
		- A list of the most recent handful of directions is also shown in the top left as a list?
	Select: Triggers the combo chain, unleashing a string of attacks against the opponent.
	A Button: Saves the active attack chain to a combo chain. To be triggered later by the player with the Select button.
		- If it's a valid attack chain, it's added to the combo.
		- If it's an invalid attack chain, it's ignored. And the attack chain is set back to an empty list.
	B Button: Dodge (Backstep) to avoid enemy attacks. Similar to how the player moves in Punch Out.
		- Ideally have a short and long backstep, depending on how long the button is held (up to a maximum length).
		- Cancels all active attack chains, but leaves the combo chain (locked in attacks) unchanged.
	Start: Pause (if I can afford to reserve this space)
		- Provide a way to show all the combos to the player here. A visual representation of how to active them via the arrow keys.

(This is OK so far. But I feel like primarily using the arrow keys won't FEEL like you're fighting. You need to use both hands.)
	- Can I incorporate a way to have combos be both arrow keys AND A or B?
	- Maybe it's fine. Just ponder whether there's a nice way to get more utility out of button combinations.

Button combination ideas:
	A + B:
	B + UP:
	B + DOWN: Delete the active attack chain without triggering a dodge. (Useful for players wanting to restart a combo without being punished.)
	A + SELECT:
	B + SELECT: 

* Alternate idea: Select toggles between "Dodge" mode and "Attack" mode.
	- The other buttons are used in forming combos, or dodging certain attacks (Jump, backstep, dodge left, dodge right, etc.)

March 2024:
------------
A new idea permeates. Helldivers-esque combos that the player inputs on the control pad, and confirms with an A press.
The player is fixed in place, they can only dodge backward with the B button (which also cancels the active chain of directional inputs, canceling their current attack they're queueing.)
The enemy is also fixed, moving through its own chain of randomized attacks and breaks. Certain attacks and moments will have weaknesses, allow certain damage types to be more or less effective.
	- E.g. Enemy attacks to your right? Hit him from the left!
The player can input a chain of directions (e.g ->,->,-> = A simple rightward slash), then confirm it with A to add it to a combo queue.
	- If it's an invalid combo, nothing gets added (display this to the player, but don't punish them with time loss. Maybe use an emote above the player character.)
Pressing B will cancel the current active attack inputs. Pressing it while no combo is active will trigger a backward dodge instead (similar to that present in Punch Out).
	- The player will be locked into a brief animation while this dodge occurs, but be immune to damage for the duration.
	- There should be a small cooldown on dodging, so that players are punished for dodging too early, or constantly.
Once the player has built up a queued combo, they can unleash it with the Select button.
	- This can cause one of two things (I need to decide):
	1. All the queued attacks rattle off automatically, one by one. The player is not immune during this duration.
	2. The player character assumes a different stance, now they are attacking, and each A press will trigger their next attack in the queue (FIFO) until they run out.
		- Once out of attacks, they return to the planning state, where they are assembling a queue of attacks.

TBD:
-------
1. Think of an elegant way (within sprite limits) to show the current combo to the player.
	- What about a row of small, unique icons for each attack in the queue?
2. Think of an elegant way to show all the combos that can be performed (ideally WHILE they're inputting them, but that's tricky).
	- Consider using the Menu layer for this?
	- A simple solution would be to show all possible attacks on the pause menu (accessed via Start), which could overlay the whole screen. But that definitely feels clunky.

Late Feb 2023:
--------------
More developments. Focus for a Mike Tyson's Punch-Out! style of fighting. Emphasis on a few key enemies (mainly singular bosses) that must be attacked/dodged with tight timing and patterns.
	- Blend in some ideas from souls-like fights.
	- Allow for 4 directional movement, but largely have the player attack facing Up.
	- Sword swings should have a lag to them, a quick backstep with a short lag, a quick parry with a longer lag.
	- Focus on mastering patterns, and then designing unique patterns for each boss.
	- Then add in projectiles and bullet-hell style obstacles to add layers of difficulty.
		~ Also mix multiple enemy types at once. Or weak enemies + a big boss.
	- What about a few different strikes?
		~ Overhead, swing left, swing right, stab.
	- Select could select your attack type
		~ Then you could use particular attacks at particular times during an opponent's attacks.
			~ Let it be real-time, but as a sort of Rock/Paper/Scissors mechanic.
			  Players would need to read what attack type their opponent is using, and then switch to the correct corresponding move to best counter it.
		~ Imagine a UI where there's a card on the lower left or right showing the active Attack type.
		~ Would be even BETTER if you could add attack types that are granted by party members.
			~ Need to medititate on this more to determine exactly what that would look like.


Feb 2023:
----------
Combat will exist entirely of Aylmera fighting enemies alone. However, each ally you get will unlock a different ability/buff she can use.
	- Perhaps even a handful of abilities. Or ones that change as the story progresses?
	- They could also be used to infuse a certain element with Aylmera, allowing her to hit enemies with that type with her basic attacks.
Narratively, it's explained that these other characters assist Aylmera, but are not fighters themselves (which makes sense).
I need to flesh out precisely how enemies will attack. If they attack by changing floor tiles to be damaging, cleansing as a mechanic could work.

Abilities:
1. Jester
	- Knife throw or a straight stab. Deals poisonous DoT damage.
	- Either make it ranged, or make it a very short hitbox (requiring getting close) that inflicts a good DoT.
2. Neera
	- AoE damage and/or a cleanse of surrounding floor tiles.
	- Could potentially heal (maybe only if floor tiles are cleansed?)
3. Alexandros
	- Projectile fire blast in front of the character.
A number of these feel rather lame and as though they've been done before. Try to think outside the box about more interesting options.

These abilities should each be on separate cooldowns. (Or perhaps one global cooldown)
	- They are not meant to be spammed.

Controls:
	The player will press Select to cycle through the active team member buffing them. From there, using "B" will use the ability.

Oct 16, 2022:
--------------
Design a combat system that borrows from Mike Tyson's Punch Out in some ways. Imagine enemies having real-time attacks with weakpoints mixed in.
	- The player has to close the distance appropriately to capitalize on these openings.
	- Could also have controlling the player (e.g. knocking them away) impact the fight.
Another idea is having multiple phases where enemies are totally exposed and not.
	1. Full exposure would mean you deal damage to them, or full damage to them.
	2. Otherwise, they're in a defensive stance, meaning you have to shred armor before dealing damage (e.g. 5 shield icons that must be removed first)
		- This would reward learning the patterns, but allow players to attack however they please.

Aug 2, 2022:
-------------
What if it was a top-down fighter style bullet hell, where you can attack, block, parry, etc. Against enemies and projectiles.
	- This would take place in a battle scenario, so it's not in the overworld.
However! The twist is that you only ever play as a single character at a time, but you can Swap between characters at will.
	- Allowing you to combo different moves and elements together.
	- This would be very Genshin Impact-esque, though adapted for top-down GBC combat.
	- It would also be reminiscent of Legend of Zelda boss fights. Though with more intrigue.
	- Whoever you're currently swapped in to is who takes damage.
		~ Maybe just bind Select to character swap. It could just cycle between them.
		~ Unless I could do button combos, then "Button + Left" vs "Button + Right" could cycle directions.
Having different characters have different ways to mitigate getting hit might be interesting (but too much difference would just be annoying)
	- E.g. One character JUMPS over projectiles
	- Another can just hold a BLOCK button
	- A third can PARRY attacks (or maybe ALL characters can parry)
	- The real limit here is going to be the amount of buttons you have, and how much interaction with projectiles you can add in.
If one character dies, it needs to immediately toggle to the next available character.
	- If no characters are left (who are alive) then send to a Game Over screen.
	- I'd love a graphic similar to Fallout and Fallout 2, where is shows the player's bones rotting away somewhere.
		~ Could attach to it a dialogue note about how they returned to the ashes and nothing they once were.
		~ Additionally, consider using RNG to pull a variety of quotes out whenever you die.

New:
-----
1. What if there are different damage types for enemies (a la space station 13)
	- And 100% of an enemy's HP type in ONE area must be depleted in order to kill them.
	- Enemies would have different HP levels
		~ E.g. Slimes would have LOTS of brute protection, but less burn and toxin protections
	- Enemies could be examined via abilities to learn of potential weaknesses.
		~ This information could even be explained via lore books found throughout the world.
	- A way to know ROUGHLY how much of a damage type you've done would be helpful
2. Still have traditional JRPG style battles, but now with different damage type attacks.
	- And each character could have specialties (e.g. Aylmera can deal the most direct Brute of anyone)
3. It would be cool to have these same damage types for the Player's party, but that UI would be difficult to implement, especially given limitations. Definitely sleep on it.

Old:
-----
1. Lanes of Combat
	- Each character can attack a lane (even empty ones).
	- Enemies move, or take up space in different lanes.
	- They also position themselves where certain lanes are defended, while others might not be. 
		~ E.g. Shield covering right-side, not the other.
	- Player has to adapt to enemy movements and defensive adjustments.
	- Player and enemy attacks can hit multiple lanes of combat.
	- Player can swap the order of their team around as well.
		~ Enemies tend to attack in front of themselves.
	- Combat options:
		a. Attack
			~ Branches into a typical physical hit vs a selection of skills.
		b. Move (Swap)
		c. Items
		d. Run

	Expanding the idea:
		What if there was no move option?
			- Just put skills in the 2nd slot directly.
		Could ignore MP altogether. Instead just have skills with tradeoffs.
			- Some skills fatigue you for your next attack.
			- Others lower your defense, or offense, etc.

	Can I combine the avatar into part of the healthbar sprite?
		- Have it be the first 16x16. (Hidden if the member hasn't joined)
			~ Hide the HP bar as well. (Just set the tiles to be all black).
		- Otherwise, the other 2 tiles serve as the HP bar.
			~ Visual only, it won't include a number at all, just a percentage reputation w/ descriptor.
			~ Could also have a color that changes as you get more beat up (Green/Yellow/Red).
	
	COULD assemble multiple different battle screens (with the avatars drawn on the background).
		- And just call the appropriate one.
		- Then you could attach HP and MP together.
			~ But honestly, MP kinda sucks. Not having it could be cool.

	Imagine if you had 2 frame animations that could flip the HP card over and reveal "DEAD" on the back.
	
	The center area can hold the actor whose action is currently being decided.
		- Maybe add the text above it saying 'Attacker' or something.
	
	-----------------
	Just design a simple Fight only system where you can select Enemy 1, 2, 3, or 4 to attack (depending on how many on-screen).
		- Also add in an Escape mechanic

Dialogue Design:
=================
"Local" variables actually consume one of the ~700 globals that you are constrainted to. So don't use them. Instead use globals and re-use them across Acts of the game.

True Globals I'll need across Acts:
------------------------------------
	1. withJester
	2. withNeera
	3. withAlexandros
	4. hasFireStone
	5. hasAirStone
	6. hasWaterStone
	7. hasEarthStone
	8. hasAetherStone
	9. hasRestoredAetherStone

How can I design a dialogue tree to cleanly consume variables?
	- Everything will need to be nested based on sub-dialogue trees.
	- Use variable flags to take advantage of the full 16 bits (booleans) offered per variable. Avoid using plain booleans.

Inspiration for tracks:
0. Introduction/Prologue
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charon%27s_obol
	- Draw a few third-person images of the player's body into a scene, then show dialogue and a black screen to the player.
	- Play a wooshing noise as the player awakens.
	- Or try a heartbeat-like noise as the player begins to awaken.
	- Similar to what's done in Link's Awakening after the lightning strike (I think).
	- "Be thrust once more into the plague of the living!"

1. The Aether Ruins
	- The wreck of the great tower and its library of knowledge. Should have a feeling similar to Unnatural City from Pat Labor 2.
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEK6l02Rl5U
		
2. The Oubliette
	- General unease. Distrust of everyone around you. Confusion. Eeriee environment (why am I here?).

II. Battle trigger music (for scene transition)

V. Old Chain Gang Songs

		- Could be used to introduce the Lord's territory as the player encounters actual chaingang members.
		- Could be a character on horseback overlooking them, who is a minor antagonist.
			~ Aylmera: "Sir? Who are these laborers? Why are they in chains?"
			~ Antag: "They're dissenters. Working off their debts to the Realm."
			~ Neera: "The Realm? Funny. I thought the Crown had banned slavery in all its forms." (this is sarcastically a dig at the Jester, as this was a key point of contention with necromancy in the Great War)
			~ Antag: "I don't recall mentioning the Crown."
			~ Aylmera: "Seems a rather large group to dissent. How can you be sure you're not opposing the will of the people?"
			~ Antag: "Their chains are evidence enough of their crimes. Certainly your understanding is as clear?"
			~ Jester: *whispered* "We've no need to make an enemy of this man. Needless bloodshed will only delay us from reaching Alexandros."
			~ Aylmera: *whispered* "You're wrong. It is HE who has made an enemy of us."
			~ Jester: "..." (this is him beginning to experiment with understanding a different set of beliefs about what's best for the Realm)
			~ Aylmera: "My understanding is crystal clear."
			[Combat triggers.]

			(The music should cease after the battle, and instead perhaps just an ambient windy noise? Or nothing at all? It should feel eerie.)
			(After the battle is won, an NPC will be near the edge of the screen who can be conversed with.)
			~ Freed laborer: "We appreciate what you've done for us, truly. Shame we don't have anything to offer you."
			~				 "Only advice I can give is to be wary of the Aether Ruins. The stories I hear are... unsettling."
			~				 "Folks say the Divines can't hear your prayers out that way. It's why the wizards built that tower in the first place. Gave them enough silence to focus."
			~				 "Anyhow. Thanks again, stranger. We won't forget your kindness."
			"There's nothing more to say." (Text when attempting to converse further.)

		https://soundcloud.com/manicfocus/putting-all-of-my-people-on-feat-probcause
	b. Clockwork from the OFF Ost
		- Builds anxiety well with the ticking that gets faster and faster. Could use that as a core for a track.
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy_MFtTFhd8
	c. Queen of the Damned - The Perfect Violin Solo 
		- Intense violin. Try to recreate the speed of it with vibrato effects.
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3XQ3EWdKkM
	d. Denzel Curry's Ricky
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WHm6tfvKlk
		- Has a very funky beat, some of its sounds can likely be imitated on GB.
		- Speed it up, esp. the tempo of the percussion.
		- Play it at 1.5x speed for an idea of what it should sound like (maybe even 2x)
	e. Violin Vivaldi Four Seasons
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2owFZhRa6V8
		- Is very fast paced, see if you can recreate parts of it with the vibrato violin.
	f. Violin The Epic Baroque Rafael Krux
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_f7qf3CBw0
		- Speed it up and add some punchy bass.

	- Ozzy Osbourne - Iron Man
		~ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iDoAkWT3L8
		~ Great plodding lead in for right before an engagement.
		~ Speed up the tempo a bit for parts.
	- Dead Boys - Sonic Reducer
		~ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIkXdFCT-Uc
		~ Good lead in to a fight theme.
	https://charliewinsmore.bandcamp.com/track/manic-in-hokkaido
		~ Has a good beat that feels intense and psycho for combat (around @1:30). Speed up the tempo and see how it sounds.
	https://charliewinsmore.bandcamp.com/track/scumbag-season
		~ The initial beat is good. Speed it up and add higher tempo percussion to make it more punchy for combat.
	- Engravings by Ethan Bortnick
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_tsn3dx5aY
		~ See if you can recreate a chord sound with the 2 duties + a wave, then have the noise in the background.
		~ Or REALLY try for 1 duty + wave + noise, and have the precussion just played only on the notes it's necessary.
	- Black Blade - Blue Öyster Cult
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p1yaNC1mNg
		~ The Outro is very funky and amped up. Would make a great basis.
	- Click Click - The English Beat
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mOGY6dzVss
		~ Bit more upbeat.
	- Unknown (Prof?)
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BABfl3Z8hEQ
			Alt link: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/BABfl3Z8hEQ
		~ Insane beat that's distorted. Perfect for a fight.

		- Also 1:55ish has a different vibe.
	- Dialogue before an engagement
		~ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuO0Rk-cRio
		~ Use the intro of this track.
	- Hard bass line similar to this:
		~ https://www.youtube.com/shorts/87DI1URzces
XIV. Vivian's Battle Theme
	- Themes: Outward anger at a world that's wronged her. Quickness/Agility. Piercing/Sharpness. Ambush.
	- Fast paced, slow build-up to quick jabs of sound (similar to that of stringing an arrow slowly, and rapidly firing it).
		~ Perhaps loud, bassy drums that HIT periodically (matching the quick strikes of the rest of the song)
	- Just jump right into the song without much buildup at ALL.
	- Try it in F Major (Furious).
XV. Farmland/Village ambience
	- Try the following beat for inspiration: 
		https://soundcloud.com/grieves-official/man-down-feat-chris-webby
XVI. Ideas for music to Create
	- A theme for each main character
		~ Alternately, just play a series of notes as a sound effect matching the instrument/theme of the character being swapped in.
		~ Outline the emotions of each character to better craft their themes.
XVII. Idea for early combat theme (sounds heroic)
	- https://soundcloud.com/kembe_x/cozy-forever-1
XVIII. Track for ambient unease, but a groove. Aether vibes?
	- Gaslamp Killer - Nerf
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H9O7ZPuVQQ
XXI. Track for introspection
	- JZAC - Rain Check
	- https://soundcloud.com/substreamrecords/jzac-rain-check
		~ When the song transitions around 1:00
		~ It has a simple melody of notes which sounds melancholy.
